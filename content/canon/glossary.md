## 1. Purpose of the Document

This document defines a controlled glossary for the Ritual Music Systems repository. Its purpose is to stabilize terminology, prevent semantic drift, and ensure consistent interpretation of system-level concepts across all canonical layers.

The glossary is descriptive and restrictive. It does not introduce new concepts.

## 2. Definition

A **glossary** is a bounded set of operational definitions that assign stable meaning to terms as they are used within this system, independent of external or colloquial usage.

Glossary definitions override intuitive, artistic, or industry-standard interpretations.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without a controlled glossary:

* Terms accumulate multiple implicit meanings
* External discourse contaminates internal usage
* Canon documents require reinterpretation
* Governance enforcement becomes ambiguous

The system loses semantic stability even if structural rules remain intact.

## 4. Why Failure Occurs Without It

Failure occurs when:

* Common words are assumed to be self-explanatory
* Definitions shift subtly across documents
* AI-generated language introduces synonym drift
* Metaphorical usage replaces procedural meaning

In such conditions, disagreement emerges from language rather than structure.

## 5. Core Terms

### Canon

The stabilized, authoritative layer of the system containing validated frameworks, governance rules, and procedural invariants. Canon is conservative and changes only through explicit governance action.

### Lab

The exploratory layer of the system where unvalidated ideas, experiments, rejections, and lineage notes are developed without canonical authority.

### Framework

A system-level construct composed of multiple documents that together define a coherent domain of operation. Frameworks are not single files.

### Governance

The set of mechanisms that regulate change, enforce constraints, and preserve system stability over time.

### Evolutionary Governance

A governance approach that treats change as selection under constraint rather than optimization or improvement.

### Operational Governance

The procedural layer that executes governance mechanisms such as drift detection, re-centering, release, and freeze.

### Drift

Any deviation from defined constraints, procedures, or roles, regardless of perceived benefit or output quality.

### Re-centering

A subtractive corrective process that restores alignment with canonical constraints without nostalgia or expressive preference.

### Failure

A structural condition in which a system component no longer fulfills its defined role, independent of output quality.

### Collapse

A terminal or near-terminal system state reached when compounded failures exceed recovery capacity.

### Ritual

A procedural structure composed of repeatable, non-expressive actions governed by constraints. Ritual is not symbolic or narrative within this system.

### Expression

Any attribution of intent, emotion, meaning, or authorship to system outputs. Expression is excluded from evaluation and governance.

### Iteration

Repeated system execution used to explore constraint boundaries, not to pursue improvement.

### Constraint

A non-negotiable rule that limits system behavior to preserve coherence and stability.

### Selection

The process by which system elements persist or are rejected based on survival under constraint, not preference.

### Extinction

The deliberate removal or archival of system elements that no longer meet constraints or governance requirements.

## 6. Operational Implications

* Glossary definitions are binding across all canon documents
* New terms require explicit glossary inclusion before canonical use
* Synonyms are discouraged unless formally defined
* Ambiguous language is treated as a drift signal

The glossary is enforced, not referenced optionally.

## 7. AI-Specific Considerations

AI systems increase semantic instability by introducing varied phrasing and implicit synonymy.

Therefore:

* Glossary terms must be reused verbatim in canon documents
* AI-generated paraphrasing is restricted in canonical contexts
* Deviations in terminology trigger review

Language variation is treated as risk.

## 8. Failure Conditions

This glossary is considered failed if:

* Terms are used inconsistently across canon
* Definitions are implicitly overridden
* New terms appear without inclusion
* Metaphorical usage replaces defined meaning

Failure requires glossary revision or enforcement action.

## 9. Systemic Role Within the Framework

The glossary provides semantic governance.

It enables:

* Stable interpretation across time
* Reduced dependency on contextual explanation
* Resistance to expressive and narrative drift

It underpins all other frameworks.

## 10. Summary

Terms are system components, not labels.

Meaning is enforced, not inferred.

The system remains coherent by controlling language.
