## 1. Purpose of the Document

This document defines the operational boundary between canon and lab within the Ritual Music Systems repository. Its purpose is to prevent epistemic contamination, methodological drift, and premature canonization by enforcing a strict separation between stabilized frameworks and exploratory work.

## 2. Definition

Canon is the stabilized, conservative layer of the system that encodes validated frameworks, governance rules, and procedural invariants.  
Lab is the exploratory layer where unvalidated ideas, speculative structures, experiments, rejections, and lineage notes are developed without canonical authority.

The boundary is procedural, not qualitative. Lab content is not inferior; it is simply not yet stabilized.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit canon–lab boundaries:

- Experimental ideas leak into authoritative frameworks  
- Canon becomes volatile and reactive  
- Governance loses enforcement power  
- Historical reasoning becomes irrecoverable  
- Rejected or superseded ideas are silently overwritten  

## 4. Why Failure Occurs Without It

Failure occurs when:

- Canon is treated as a workspace instead of a reference layer  
- Exploratory documents are retroactively rewritten into canon  
- Iterative experiments overwrite their own lineage  
- Governance decisions are made implicitly rather than procedurally  

In such conditions, the system cannot distinguish knowledge from activity.

## 5. Operational Implications

- Canon documents must not be used for experimentation, drafting, or ideation  
- All speculative, provisional, or uncertain material must reside in `/lab`  
- Promotion from lab to canon requires explicit governance action  
- Canon changes are rare, deliberate, and versioned  
- Lab may contain contradictions, dead ends, and parallel approaches  

Deletion of lab material is discouraged; rejection is a form of documentation.

## 6. AI-Specific Considerations

AI-assisted generation increases the risk of boundary collapse due to fluent synthesis that obscures epistemic status and implicit normalization of experimental language.

Therefore:

- AI output defaults to lab unless explicitly canonized  
- Canonical documents must resist stylistic novelty  
- Procedural repetition is preferred over expressive variation  

AI is treated as a generator of candidates, not an authority.

## 7. Failure Conditions

This governance mechanism is considered failed if:

- Canon documents include speculative language or open-ended framing  
- Lab documents are cited as authoritative references  
- Canon is modified without versioning or governance justification  
- Rejected ideas disappear instead of being archived  

Failure requires corrective action, not reinterpretation.

## 8. Systemic Role Within the Framework

Canon–lab separation is the containment layer of the system.  
It enables conservative evolution, drift detection and recovery, historical traceability, and non-destructive iteration.

## 9. Summary

Canon is stable memory.  
Lab is controlled volatility.

The system survives by never confusing the two.

Canon does not explore.  
Lab does not decide.
