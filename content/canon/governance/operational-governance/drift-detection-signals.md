## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document formalizes **drift detection signals** as a core mechanism of *operational governance*. It defines how stylistic, liturgical, and ritual drift is detected **before** it becomes collapse, and how detection is translated into mandatory action.

Detection is not interpretation. It is a mechanical precondition for re-centering.

---

## 2. Scope and Boundaries

Drift detection applies **only** to operational execution. It does not govern:

* Philosophical principles
* Methodological rules
* Canonical evolution (handled by evolutionary governance)

Detection covers three operational layers:

1. **Style Layer** – musical gravity, density, pacing, form
2. **Liturgy Layer** – language structure, repetition, vocal function
3. **Ritual Layer** – prompting, iteration cadence, evaluation behavior

---

## 3. Definition

**Drift detection signals** are:

> Observable indicators that operational execution is diverging from the anchor style and ritual procedures, regardless of output quality or intent.

Signals do not judge success or failure. They trigger governance procedures.

---

## 4. Detection Principles

All detection follows these invariants:

1. **Artifact-agnostic** – signals are derived from patterns, not from liking or disliking outputs
2. **Early-warning** – signals appear before explicit rule violations
3. **Non-emotional** – affect is excluded as an input
4. **Action-bound** – detection always maps to a predefined response

If a signal cannot trigger an action, it must not exist.

---

## 5. Signal Classification

Signals are classified along two axes:

* **Strength**: weak vs strong
* **Trigger mode**: cumulative vs immediate

This prevents overreaction while ensuring timely correction.

---

## 6. Style Layer Signals

### 6.1 Weak (Cumulative) Style Signals

Examples:

* Gradual tempo acceleration across outputs
* Increasing variation in track structure
* Subtle emergence of sectional contrast
* Instrumentation shifting toward clarity or brightness

Trigger condition:

* Two or more weak signals within a cycle

---

### 6.2 Strong (Immediate) Style Signals

Examples:

* Audible climax or payoff
* Recognizable song-like structure
* Hook-like repetition with resolution

Trigger condition:

* Any single strong signal

---

## 7. Liturgy Layer Signals

### 7.1 Weak (Cumulative) Liturgy Signals

Examples:

* Increased descriptive language
* Reduced repetition density
* More varied phrasing between lines

Trigger condition:

* Two weak signals within a cycle

---

### 7.2 Strong (Immediate) Liturgy Signals

Examples:

* Emergence of metaphor or imagery
* Language implying inner state or emotion
* Vocal delivery implying a speaking subject

Trigger condition:

* Any single strong signal

---

## 8. Ritual (Process) Layer Signals

### 8.1 Weak (Cumulative) Ritual Signals

Examples:

* Prompt length increasing over time
* Incremental addition of stylistic modifiers
* Evaluation discussions becoming longer
* Rejection rate steadily decreasing

Trigger condition:

* Two weak signals within a cycle

---

### 8.2 Strong (Immediate) Ritual Signals

Examples:

* Iteration framed as improvement
* Rules reinterpreted mid-session
* Evaluation delayed for reconsideration

Trigger condition:

* Any single strong signal

---

## 9. Quantitative Proxies (Optional)

Where useful, the following may be tracked:

* Average prompt length per cycle
* Acceptance-to-rejection ratio
* Time spent evaluating each output

Trends are meaningful; absolute values are not.

---

## 10. Trigger-to-Action Mapping

When a trigger condition is met:

1. **Immediate halt** of generation
2. **Ignore recent outputs** entirely
3. Invoke **style-and-ritual re-centering**
4. Resume work with reduced scope

No discretionary step exists between detection and action.

---

## 11. Prohibited Responses to Detection

The following are explicitly forbidden:

* Output-level tweaking
* Rule reinterpretation
* Emotional justification
* "One more iteration" reasoning

Detection is not a negotiation phase.

---

## 12. Failure Conditions

Drift detection has failed when:

* Signals are noticed but ignored
* Re-centering is delayed or skipped
* Drift is reframed as evolution

Such failures constitute a breakdown of operational governance.

---

## 13. Systemic Role

Drift detection signals form the system’s **early-warning nervous system**.

They enable:

* Timely correction
* Bounded drift
* Long-term stylistic coherence

Without detection, re-centering becomes reactive and unreliable.

---

## 14. Summary

Drift detection signals convert gradual stylistic and procedural deviation into explicit, actionable events.

By separating detection from judgment and binding it to mandatory response, the system remains adaptive without losing its center.
