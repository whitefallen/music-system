## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document formalizes **governance of change** as the final component of the methodological framework. It exports a critical systemic rule: that the system itself must evolve under explicit governance, or it will drift implicitly and uncontrollably.

Governance of change defines how, when, and why canonical elements may be modified without collapsing coherence or erasing memory.

---

## 2. Definition

**Governance of change** is the practice of:

> Controlling modifications to the system through explicit procedures, versioning, and justification, rather than through gradual, undocumented adaptation.

Within this framework:

* Change is deliberate
* Stability is the default
* Memory is preserved

---

## 3. Problem Statement: Why Ungoverned Change Fails

Without governance, systems degrade through:

1. **Silent Drift**
   Small adjustments accumulate without record or intent.

2. **Retroactive Rationalization**
   Past decisions are reinterpreted to fit present preferences.

3. **Memory Loss**
   Reasons for constraints are forgotten, weakening enforcement.

4. **AI-Driven Mutation**
   Generative output subtly reshapes rules through repeated exposure.

These failures destroy long-term coherence.

---

## 4. Governance as a Structural Safeguard

Governance of change functions as a **meta-constraint**.

It enforces:

* Explicit change proposals
* Documented rationale
* Versioned updates

This allows:

* System evolution without erasure
* Accountability of decisions
* Preservation of intellectual lineage

---

## 5. Operational Implications

### 5.1 Canon vs Lab

All change originates in **lab documents**.

Canon:

* Changes rarely
* Requires justification
* Is versioned explicitly

Lab:

* Is exploratory
* May be inconsistent
* Preserves rejected paths

---

### 5.2 Change Procedure

Mandatory procedure for canonical change:

1. Identify contradiction or failure
2. Document issue in lab
3. Propose modification
4. Assess systemic impact
5. Version and apply change

Undocumented changes are prohibited.

---

### 5.3 Versioning Rules

* Minor clarifications increment patch version
* Conceptual changes increment minor version
* Foundational changes increment major version

Previous versions are retained.

---

## 6. Relationship to AI Generation

AI systems exert constant adaptive pressure.

Governance of change is essential because:

* AI output trains intuition implicitly
* Repetition normalizes deviation
* Improvement bias masks drift

Governance ensures AI does not become an undocumented co-author of the system.

---

## 7. Failure Conditions

Governance of change has failed when:

* Rules change without documentation
* Canon is rewritten casually
* Past rationale is no longer recoverable

Such failures indicate loss of system memory.

---

## 8. Systemic Role

Governance of change stabilizes:

* All methodological principles
* Canon–lab separation
* Long-term memory function

It is the immune system of the framework.

---

## 9. Summary

Governance of change enables controlled evolution without drift.

By enforcing explicit modification pathways, it preserves:

* Coherence
* Accountability
* Historical context

A system that cannot govern its own change will inevitably forget why it exists.
