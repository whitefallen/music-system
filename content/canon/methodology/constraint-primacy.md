## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document formalizes **constraint primacy** as a core methodological principle. It exports a central operational rule: that constraints outrank preference, intuition, aesthetic judgment, and output quality in all system-compliant decisions.

Constraint primacy ensures that the system remains stable under iteration, scale, and generative abundance.

---

## 2. Definition

**Constraint primacy** is the principle that:

> Explicitly defined constraints take precedence over all other evaluative signals, including emotional response, perceived quality, novelty, or effort invested.

Within this framework:

* Constraints are authoritative
* Outputs are subordinate
* Exceptions are disallowed

---

## 3. Problem Statement: Why Preference-Driven Systems Fail

When constraints are treated as flexible or secondary, systems exhibit predictable collapse modes:

1. **Taste Drift**
   Evaluation shifts subtly over time, eroding coherence.

2. **Post-Hoc Justification**
   Rules are bent to accommodate outputs that feel compelling.

3. **Inconsistent Memory**
   Decisions depend on recall rather than documentation.

4. **AI Quality Illusion**
   High-fidelity outputs mask systemic violations.

These failures compound rapidly in AI-mediated contexts.

---

## 4. Constraint Primacy as an Enforcement Mechanism

Constraint primacy functions as a **decision override system**.

It enforces:

* Binary compliance checks
* Immediate rejection upon violation
* Immunity to aesthetic persuasion

This allows:

* Predictable outcomes
* Auditable decisions
* Reduced cognitive load

---

## 5. Operational Implications

### 5.1 Constraint Types

Constraints may include:

* Philosophical constraints
* Methodological constraints
* Structural constraints
* Linguistic constraints

All constraints must be explicit, documented, and referenceable.

---

### 5.2 Evaluation Order

Mandatory evaluation sequence:

1. Constraint compliance
2. Structural integrity
3. System coherence

Affective response is not an evaluation step.

---

### 5.3 Handling Violations

When a constraint is violated:

* The output is rejected
* No repair is attempted
* No exception is granted

Effort, novelty, or perceived quality do not mitigate violations.

---

## 6. Relationship to AI Generation

Generative systems produce large volumes of plausible artifacts.

Constraint primacy is essential because:

* Volume amplifies temptation
* AI fluency mimics correctness
* Emotional response is unreliable

Without strict primacy, AI output drives the system instead of serving it.

---

## 7. Failure Conditions

Constraint primacy has failed when:

* Exceptions are justified as "necessary"
* Constraints are softened retroactively
* Outputs influence rule interpretation

Such failures indicate loss of methodological control.

---

## 8. Systemic Role

Constraint primacy underpins:

* Rejection as enforcement
* Evaluation without affect
* Governance of change

All subsequent methodological documents assume constraints cannot be overridden.

---

## 9. Summary

Constraint primacy establishes constraints as the highest authority in the system.

By subordinating outputs to rules, it enables:

* Stability under iteration
* Resistance to generative bias
* Long-term coherence

Any system that allows preference to override constraints will drift, regardless of output quality.
