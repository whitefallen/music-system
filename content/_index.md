title: "Ritual Music Systems"
description: "A formal, system-oriented approach to creating ritualistic, non-expressive, AI-mediated music"

## Purpose

This repository documents a **formal, system-oriented approach to creating ritualistic, non-expressive, AI-mediated music**. It is not a music project, an album repository, or a prompt collection. It is a **knowledge base**: a durable specification for how certain musical characteristics reliably emerge when constrained by philosophy, method, structure, and governance.

The primary goal is to **externalize memory**. No critical assumption, rule, or rationale should exist only in a person's head or in transient conversation. Everything that matters is written down, versioned, and traceable.

## What This Repository Is

* A **production specification** for ritual-oriented music systems
* A **research artifact** documenting constraints, failures, and methods
* A **model-agnostic framework** for working with generative AI
* A **public reference** that can be forked, audited, and extended

This repository describes *conditions and systems*, not aesthetic tastes or personal expression.

## Core Principles

The system documented here is built on several non-negotiable assumptions:

* **Anti-expressivism**: music is treated as procedural output, not self-expression
* **Ontological neutrality**: no moral framing, protagonists, or narrative judgment
* **Post-human orientation**: systems persist without audience or witness
* **Constraint primacy**: rigor emerges from restriction, not freedom
* **High rejection tolerance**: most outputs are expected to fail

These principles are expanded formally in the [Canon](/canon/) section.
