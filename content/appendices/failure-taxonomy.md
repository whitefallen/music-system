## 1. Purpose of the Document

This document defines a taxonomy of failure within the Ritual Music Systems repository. Its purpose is to classify failure modes systematically, enable non-interpretive diagnosis, and support procedural recovery without attribution, blame, or narrative justification.

## 2. Definition

A **failure** is a structural condition in which a system component no longer fulfills its defined role under the governing constraints, regardless of apparent output quality or short-term success.

A **failure taxonomy** is a stable classification scheme that groups failures by mechanism rather than by symptom or outcome.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without a formal failure taxonomy:

* Failures are described narratively rather than diagnostically
* Symptoms are treated as causes
* Recovery actions are improvised or inconsistent
* Collapse is recognized only after irreversibility

The system lacks a shared vocabulary for identifying and responding to breakdown.

## 4. Why Failure Occurs Without It

Failure persists undetected when:

* Coherence is mistaken for correctness
* Output fluency masks structural violations
* Governance mechanisms are bypassed silently
* Drift accumulates below the threshold of notice

In such conditions, collapse appears sudden but is structurally gradual.

## 5. Taxonomic Categories

Failures are classified into the following non-exhaustive categories:

### 5.1 Structural Failures

Failures arising from breakdowns in system architecture, layer separation, or document role definition.

Examples include:

* Layer mixing between philosophy, methodology, and governance
* Canon documents used for experimentation
* Missing or duplicated structural components

### 5.2 Governance Failures

Failures where governance mechanisms exist but do not execute.

Examples include:

* Ignored drift detection signals
* Canon modification outside release cycles
* Canon–lab boundary violations without correction

### 5.3 Methodological Failures

Failures involving violation or erosion of methodological constraints.

Examples include:

* Expressive optimization overriding constraint primacy
* Iteration treated as improvement
* Evaluation reintroducing affect or preference

### 5.4 Evolutionary Failures

Failures in the application of evolutionary logic.

Examples include:

* Accumulation without extinction
* Selection based on novelty rather than survival under constraint
* Adaptation of governance to outputs instead of enforcement

### 5.5 Tooling and AI-Induced Failures

Failures introduced or amplified by tooling characteristics.

Examples include:

* Fluency mistaken for compliance
* High-volume generation bypassing review
* Implicit normalization through repetition

## 6. Operational Implications

* Failures are identified by category before remediation
* Multiple categories may apply to a single incident
* Remediation targets mechanisms, not outputs
* Logging a failure is mandatory, not discretionary

Failure classification precedes recovery action.

## 7. AI-Specific Considerations

AI systems increase failure opacity by producing coherent artifacts under violated constraints.

Therefore:

* AI output is never treated as evidence of system health
* Detection focuses on process adherence, not surface quality
* Automated systems require explicit checkpoints for failure classification

AI accelerates collapse when failure taxonomy is absent.

## 8. Failure Conditions

This taxonomy is considered failed if:

* Failures are discussed without classification
* Recovery actions precede diagnosis
* Categories are treated as rhetorical labels
* New failure patterns are ignored rather than incorporated

Failure of the taxonomy requires revision of the classification scheme.

## 9. Systemic Role Within the Framework

The failure taxonomy provides the diagnostic substrate for all collapse analysis.

It enables:

* Early detection of systemic breakdown
* Consistent language across recovery efforts
* Separation of failure from blame or intent

It is foundational for collapse modeling and post-failure analysis.

## 10. Summary

Failure is structural, not exceptional.

Classification precedes correction.

The system survives by recognizing failure early and without interpretation.
