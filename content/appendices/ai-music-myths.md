## 1. Purpose of the Document

This document enumerates and neutralizes common myths surrounding AI-mediated music creation as they relate to the Ritual Music Systems repository. Its purpose is to prevent misinterpretation of system intent, scope, and operational logic by explicitly rejecting narrative, expressive, and optimization-driven assumptions.

## 2. Definition

An **AI music myth** is a persistent explanatory narrative that attributes intent, creativity, authorship, or progress to AI systems beyond their defined procedural role.

Myths are not errors of fact alone; they are errors of framing.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit myth neutralization:

* The system is misread as a creative project
* Expressive intent is projected onto procedural outputs
* Evaluation criteria drift toward aesthetics and preference
* Governance constraints are overridden by narrative appeal

This results in external and internal pressure to violate system constraints.

## 4. Why Failure Occurs Without It

Failure occurs when:

* Output quality is equated with system correctness
* AI is treated as an author or collaborator
* Novelty is mistaken for advancement
* Ritual framing is interpreted symbolically rather than procedurally

In such conditions, myths displace governance.

## 5. Common Myths and Rejections

### 5.1 Myth: AI Is Creative

Rejection: AI systems generate outputs through constrained transformation and recombination. Creativity is not a system property within this framework and is neither measured nor pursued.

### 5.2 Myth: Better Models Produce Better Meaning

Rejection: Model capability does not confer semantic authority. Meaning attribution is external and non-operative within the system.

### 5.3 Myth: Expression Equals Value

Rejection: Expressive intensity, emotional resonance, and affective response are explicitly excluded from evaluation criteria.

### 5.4 Myth: Iteration Leads to Improvement

Rejection: Iteration is used to explore constraint boundaries, not to optimize toward subjective quality.

### 5.5 Myth: Ritual Is Symbolic or Narrative

Rejection: Ritual elements are treated as procedural structures, not symbolic communication or metaphorical expression.

### 5.6 Myth: Automation Guarantees Progress

Rejection: Increased automation raises collapse risk by compressing failure timelines and obscuring governance violations.

## 6. Operational Implications

* Myth identification precedes interpretive discussion
* Narrative explanations are treated as drift signals
* Documentation favors procedure over description
* External communication references this document as a boundary

Myths are managed through subtraction, not debate.

## 7. AI-Specific Considerations

AI systems amplify myth formation due to fluency, coherence, and apparent intentionality.

Therefore:

* Anthropomorphic language is treated as a violation
* Model upgrades do not justify framework revision
* Output narratives are disregarded unless procedurally relevant

AI is a tool, not a subject.

## 8. Failure Conditions

This document is considered failed if:

* Myths are acknowledged but tolerated
* Expressive language enters canonical evaluation
* AI intent is implied in governance or methodology
* Ritual structures are explained symbolically

Failure requires reassertion of procedural framing.

## 9. Systemic Role Within the Framework

This document functions as a defensive boundary against interpretive drift.

It enables:

* Stable external communication
* Internal consistency under scrutiny
* Resistance to anthropomorphic and aesthetic pressure

It preserves the system’s non-expressive orientation.

## 10. Summary

Myths are framing errors, not harmless metaphors.

The system operates without intent, expression, or progress narratives.

Clarity is maintained by refusing explanation where procedure suffices.
