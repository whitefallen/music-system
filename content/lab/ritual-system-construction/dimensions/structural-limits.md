title: "Structural Limits"

## 1. Purpose

This document defines Structural Limits as a mandatory design dimension in the construction of ritual systems.

Its purpose is to constrain scale, repetition, duration, and accumulation within ritual systems, ensuring that form remains bounded and resistant to inflation, verbosity, and uncontrolled expansion.

Structural limits govern quantity and proportion, not expression.

## 2. Definition

Structural limits are explicit quantitative and proportional constraints applied to ritual systems.

They define maximums, minimums, and thresholds for linguistic, sonic, and procedural elements.

Structural limits are preventative constraints, not corrective measures.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit structural limits:

* rituals expand indefinitely
* repetition becomes indulgent rather than doctrinal
* density escalates as compensation
* platform constraints are discovered only after failure

This dimension prevents scale drift and epic inflation.

## 4. Linguistic Limits

Ritual systems must explicitly declare:

* maximum line length
* minimum line length (if applicable)
* maximum total utterance length per ritual act
* conditions under which rupture or truncation is permitted

Limits must support chant-breath delivery and endurance.

## 5. Repetition Limits

Repetition must be bounded.

Ritual systems must declare:

* maximum repetition count per segment
* whether repetition is exact or variant
* conditions that terminate repetition

Repetition without declared termination constitutes drift.

## 6. Sonic Density Limits

Structural limits apply to sonic accumulation.

Ritual systems must declare:

* maximum simultaneous active agents
* thresholds for reduction or collapse
* whether density may oscillate or only decrease

Unbounded sonic growth is prohibited.

## 7. Silence as Structure

Silence is a bounded structural element.

Ritual systems must declare:

* whether silence is permitted
* how silence is represented (e.g. tokens, gaps)
* maximum and minimum silence duration

Implicit silence is forbidden.

## 8. Platform Constraints

Ritual systems must account for platform-imposed limits.

Declarations may include:

* maximum prompt length
* structural segmentation to avoid truncation
* avoidance of convoluted instruction

Ignoring platform constraints constitutes system failure.

## 9. Relationship to Other Dimensions

Structural limits apply across all dimensions.

If conflict arises:

* structural limits override stylistic preference
* structural limits constrain repetition doctrine
* structural limits enforce atmospheric restraint

Structural limits are non-negotiable.

## 10. Failure Conditions

This dimension is considered failed if:

* limits are implicit or undefined
* repetition exceeds declared bounds
* scale escalates to compensate for constraint absence
* platform truncation alters ritual structure

Failure invalidates the affected ritual output.

## 11. Systemic Role

Structural limits preserve proportionality and restraint within ritual systems.

They ensure that ritual form remains stable, repeatable, and resistant to inflation or collapse.
