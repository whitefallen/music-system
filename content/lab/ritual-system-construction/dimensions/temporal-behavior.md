title: "Temporal Behavior"

## 1. Purpose

This document defines Temporal Behavior as a mandatory design dimension in the construction of ritual systems.

Its purpose is to constrain how ritual systems behave over time, preventing implicit progression, escalation, or resolution narratives from emerging through duration, repetition, or accumulation.

Temporal behavior governs time as structure, not as story.

## 2. Definition

Temporal behavior is the declared manner in which a ritual system unfolds, persists, repeats, or terminates over its duration.

It defines whether time is treated as static, cyclic, degrading, sealing, or finite, and how transitions between temporal states are permitted.

Temporal behavior is procedural, not developmental.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit temporal constraints:

* rituals default to linear progression
* intensity escalates implicitly over time
* endings imply resolution or catharsis
* repetition accumulates toward climax

This dimension replaces narrative time with enforceable temporal structure.

## 4. Temporal Modes

Each ritual system must explicitly declare one or more permitted temporal modes:

* static (no directional change)
* cyclic (bounded repetition)
* degrading (progressive reduction or erosion)
* sealing (closure without release)
* finite (fixed duration without implication)

Implicit temporal modes are forbidden.

## 5. Transitions and Phase Changes

If temporal transitions are permitted, ritual systems must declare:

* allowed transition types
* maximum number of transitions
* conditions that trigger transition
* irreversible vs reversible transitions

Unbounded or reactive transitions constitute drift.

## 6. Escalation and Accumulation

Temporal escalation is prohibited by default.

Ritual systems must explicitly declare whether:

* accumulation is permitted
* reduction is mandatory
* intensity must remain invariant

Escalation toward climax, payoff, or release is forbidden unless explicitly constrained.

## 7. End-State Behavior

Ritual systems must declare their end-state behavior.

Permitted end-states may include:

* sealed (closed, irrevocable)
* exhausted (spent without resolution)
* unresolved (suspended without implication)
* terminated (abrupt cessation)

End-states must not imply narrative completion or reward.

## 8. Relationship to Atmosphere and Liturgy

Temporal behavior conditions atmosphere and liturgy.

* Atmosphere must remain consistent with declared temporal mode
* Liturgy must not introduce progression that time forbids

If conflict arises, temporal behavior prevails.

## 9. Drift Detection

Temporal drift is indicated when:

* progression or buildup appears without declaration
* endings suggest catharsis or payoff
* repetition accumulates toward climax
* time implies narrative development

Detected drift requires immediate re-centering or system suspension.

## 10. Failure Conditions

This dimension is considered failed if:

* temporal mode is implicit
* escalation occurs without constraint
* end-state implies resolution
* time adapts to output preference

Failure invalidates the affected ritual output.

## 11. Systemic Role

Temporal behavior preserves ritual systems from narrative time and musical teleology.

It ensures that duration, repetition, and endings remain structural, austere, and non-expressive.
