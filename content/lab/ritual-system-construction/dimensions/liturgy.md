## 1. Purpose

This document defines Liturgy as a mandatory design dimension in the construction of ritual systems.

Its purpose is to formalize how ritual speech is structured, repeated, and positioned within a ritual system, without encoding any specific text, belief content, or symbolic narrative.

Liturgy governs structure, not meaning.

## 2. Definition

Liturgy is the procedural organization of ritual utterance into defined structural segments that are performed as acts of belief.

Within this framework, liturgy is:

* devotional rather than descriptive
* performative rather than explanatory
* internal to belief rather than observational

Liturgy is not poetry, narration, or storytelling.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit liturgical structure:

* lyrics drift toward narration or commentary
* belief becomes described instead of enacted
* repetition becomes musical habit instead of ritual doctrine
* tracks collapse into songs rather than ritual acts

Liturgy externalizes ritual posture and prevents authorial distance.

## 4. Core Liturgical Principles

All liturgy within a ritual system must adhere to the following principles:

* the speaker is inside belief
* utterance performs belief rather than explaining it
* no external narrator or observer exists
* no justification or reflection is permitted

Violation of these principles constitutes liturgical failure.

## 5. Structural Segmentation

Every ritual system must define a bounded set of liturgical segments.

Common segment types may include:

* invocation
* affirmation
* renunciation
* sealing
* continuation

Segment names are functional labels, not thematic descriptors.

The allowed set of segments must be declared explicitly per ritual system.

## 6. Repetition Doctrine

Repetition within liturgy is doctrinal, not musical.

Repetition may serve to:

* reinforce belief
* enact submission
* erase ambiguity
* exhaust alternatives

Repetition must never function as emotional escalation or climax.

Limits on repetition frequency and duration must be declared.

## 7. Relationship to Language and Speech

Liturgy defines structure; language defines surface realization.

This dimension does not govern:

* vocabulary
* grammar
* register
* phonetic behavior

Those concerns are governed by the Language and Speech dimension.

## 8. Track-Level Application

Within a ritual system, each track represents a discrete ritual act.

For each track, the liturgical structure must be declared independently, even if it mirrors other tracks.

Implicit inheritance of liturgical structure is forbidden.

## 9. Failure Conditions

This dimension is considered failed if:

* liturgical structure is implicit
* lyrics describe belief instead of enacting it
* narration or commentary appears
* repetition is used for musical emphasis

Failure invalidates the affected ritual output.

## 10. Systemic Role

Liturgy ensures that ritual systems produce acts of belief rather than representations of belief.

It anchors ritual systems in performative devotion and prevents collapse into narrative or song form.
