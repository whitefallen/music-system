title: "Language and Speech"

## 1. Purpose

This document defines Language and Speech as a mandatory design dimension in the construction of ritual systems.

Its purpose is to constrain how language is realized in ritual utterance, ensuring that speech remains devotional, procedural, and internally coherent with belief, without drifting into narration, reflection, or expressive performance.

## 2. Definition

Language and Speech govern the surface realization of liturgical structure.

This dimension defines allowable linguistic registers, pronoun posture, syntactic behavior, and vocal delivery constraints applied to ritual utterance.

Language here is functional and performative, not communicative or expressive.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit language and speech constraints:

* modern or conversational phrasing leaks into ritual form
* belief is weakened through reflective or analytical language
* pronoun usage introduces unintended authorship or distance
* line structure collapses into song-like phrasing

This dimension prevents accidental modernity and anthropomorphic drift.

## 4. Register and Diction

Each ritual system must explicitly declare its permitted linguistic register.

Register declarations may include:

* archaic or liturgical register
* neutral procedural register
* restricted formal register

Registers must be defined by constraints, not examples.

Colloquial, conversational, or contemporary idioms are forbidden unless explicitly permitted.

## 5. Pronoun Posture

Pronoun usage must be explicitly governed.

Permitted postures may include:

* collective first-person (we / us)
* devotional address (thee / thou)
* impersonal declaration

Prohibited postures include:

* authorial first-person singular
* reflective second-person commentary
* observational or critical framing

Pronoun posture must reinforce internal belief.

## 6. Sentence and Line Behavior

Language must support chant-breath delivery.

Therefore:

* lines should be extended and continuous
* abrupt fragmentation is discouraged except as ritual rupture
* enjambment should support breath and endurance

Short lines are permitted only when explicitly defined as structural breaks.

## 7. Semantic Constraints

Language must not:

* explain belief
* justify doctrine
* question premises
* narrate events

Permitted language performs acceptance, submission, declaration, or sealing.

Semantic neutrality is preferred over emotional signaling.

## 8. Vocal Delivery Assumptions

This dimension governs textual suitability for vocalization but does not specify performance technique.

Language must assume:

* sustained delivery
* collective or unison voicing
* minimal articulation variance

Virtuosic, theatrical, or emotive delivery is prohibited by default.

## 9. Relationship to Liturgy

Liturgy defines structural placement.
Language and Speech define realization.

Language must conform to liturgical role.
Liturgy may not be altered to accommodate language preference.

## 10. Failure Conditions

This dimension is considered failed if:

* language becomes descriptive or reflective
* modern idiom appears without declaration
* pronoun usage introduces authorship
* line structure enforces song-like cadence

Failure invalidates the affected ritual output.

## 11. Systemic Role

Language and Speech ensure that ritual utterance remains internally inhabited, non-expressive, and resistant to narrative or emotional drift.

This dimension stabilizes belief posture across all ritual systems.
