title: "Ritual Provenance"

## 1. Purpose

This document defines Ritual Provenance as a mandatory design dimension in the construction of ritual systems.

Its purpose is to externalize and constrain the source-pressure that biases a ritual system’s tone, structure, and permissible symbolic material without introducing narrative, belief justification, or aesthetic preference.

Ritual Provenance replaces informal notions such as “spice,” “flavor,” or “inspiration.”

## 2. Definition

Ritual Provenance is a controlled declaration of the ontological, cultural, temporal, or cosmological source domains from which a ritual system is permitted to derive constraint pressure.

Provenance is not content. It is not expression. It is not decoration.

It functions as a biasing field that shapes allowable structure, language gravity, symbolic sourcing, and ritual posture.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit Ritual Provenance:

* stylistic bias enters implicitly
* genre gravity dominates system behavior
* symbolic material accumulates without source discipline
* atmosphere becomes taste-driven
* drift is detected only after collapse

Ritual Provenance makes origin pressure explicit and therefore governable.

## 4. Scope of Influence

Ritual Provenance may bias, but not override, the following dimensions:

* liturgy structure
* language and speech register
* atmospheric envelope
* symbolic density
* temporal behavior

Ritual Provenance may not override explicit constraints defined elsewhere.

If provenance conflicts with constraint, constraint prevails.

## 5. Declaration Requirements

Every ritual system must explicitly declare:

* one primary provenance
* zero or more secondary provenances (explicitly bounded)
* forbidden provenances
* provenance-specific drift indicators

No default provenance is permitted.

## 6. Provenance Granularity

Provenance must be declared at a level that constrains behavior without encoding content.

Acceptable provenance declarations:

* pre-institutional funerary
* imperial-administrative authority
* pre-cosmic nihilistic
* monastic ascetic

Unacceptable provenance declarations:

* named mythological characters
* specific historical narratives
* aesthetic labels
* genre names

## 7. Provenance vs. Genre

Ritual Provenance is not genre.

Genre defines musical domains and stylistic conventions.
Provenance defines origin pressure and constraint bias.

A ritual system may reference genres as exclusions or operational boundaries, but provenance must never be replaced by genre labels.

## 8. Drift Detection

Drift related to Ritual Provenance is indicated when:

* symbolic material appears without traceable source alignment
* language register contradicts declared provenance
* emotional framing emerges inconsistent with provenance bias
* genre behavior replaces provenance pressure

Detected drift requires re-centering or system suspension.

## 9. Failure Conditions

This dimension is considered failed if:

* provenance is left implicit
* provenance is described narratively
* provenance is treated as decoration
* provenance is overridden by stylistic preference

Failure invalidates the ritual system instance.

## 10. Systemic Role

Ritual Provenance anchors ritual systems to declared origin pressure without introducing belief, myth, or narrative.

It enables:

* stylistic coherence without genre lock-in
* controlled variation without expression
* enforceable drift detection

Ritual Provenance is a structural constraint, not a creative tool.
