title: "Suno Cohesion Conventions"
status: lab-convention
scope: suno-based-production
binding: soft

## 1. Purpose

This document records **established operational conventions** that have proven effective in maintaining tonal, stylistic, and structural cohesion across multi-track EPs produced in **Suno**.

These conventions:

- are **not canonical rules**,
- do **not** define ritual meaning, belief, or structure,
- and do **not** impose hard governance constraints.

They exist to document _execution context expectations_ that reduce stylistic drift and fragmentation during generation.

---

## 2. Scope and Applicability

These conventions apply when:

- Suno is used as the primary generation engine
- multiple tracks are intended to form a cohesive EP or ritual system

They do not apply to:

- single standalone tracks
- non-Suno generation environments
- canon definition or schema construction

---

## 3. Playlist Continuity

### Convention

- EPs are **expected** to be generated within a **single Suno playlist**.
- Playlist continuity provides implicit contextual memory across generations.
- Earlier tracks in a playlist exert stronger stylistic and tonal influence on subsequent tracks.

### Observed Effects

Using a shared playlist has been observed to:

- reduce stylistic variance between tracks
- stabilize orchestral density and pacing
- reinforce shared reverb, spatial, and temporal characteristics
- lower the need for increasingly restrictive style prompts

### Deviation

If tracks are generated outside a shared playlist, this should be noted in lab documentation.

## 4. Persona Persistence

### Convention

- A **single persona** is expected to be used per EP.
- Personas are treated as **persistent contextual stabilizers**, not creative agents.
- Persona changes mid-EP significantly increase drift risk.

### Stabilized Aspects

Persona persistence has been observed to stabilize:

- vocal ontology (e.g. choir behavior, delivery style)
- tempo bias and pacing tendencies
- orchestral balance and density
- affective ceiling (reducing unwanted uplift or expressivity)

### Deviation

If persona changes are introduced, they should be:

- explicit
- intentional
- documented as a contextual shift rather than an optimization

---

## 5. Relationship Between Playlist and Persona

- Playlists provide **horizontal continuity** (track-to-track memory).
- Personas provide **vertical continuity** (generation bias across sessions).

Used together, they form a **contextual envelope** that reduces reliance on:

- excessive negative prompt exclusions
- post-generation correction
- iterative prompt tightening

Neither replaces prompt discipline; they reinforce it.

---

## 6. Prompt Discipline (Contextual)

While not the focus of this document, effective use of playlists and personas has been observed to work best when combined with:

- long-form, descriptive style prompts
- explicit exclusion of undesired tropes
- avoidance of emotional or evaluative adjectives
- preference for first-pass acceptance over micro-iteration

These are supporting practices, not requirements.

---

## 7. Drift Considerations

Ignoring playlist or persona continuity in multi-track EPs has been observed to:

- increase stylistic divergence
- introduce unintended genre bleed
- destabilize pacing and tonal gravity

This does not invalidate results, but raises drift risk and documentation burden.

---

## 8. Relationship to Canon and Governance

- These conventions do **not** define system meaning or belief.
- They do **not** override frozen schemas or anchors.
- They do **not** authorize regeneration or modification.

They describe **execution context only**.

---

## 9. Use in Future EPs

For future Suno-based EPs:

- Playlist continuity and persona persistence should be assumed by default.
- Deviations should be explicitly noted, not justified.

No approval process is required.

---

## 10. Summary

These conventions document _how cohesion was practically achieved_, not _how it must always be achieved_.

They are intended to:

- increase reproducibility
- reduce accidental drift
- improve system legibility

They do not constrain creative intent or ritual ontology.
