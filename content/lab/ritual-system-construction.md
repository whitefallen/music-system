title: "Ritual System Construction (Lab)"
---

## 1. Purpose

This directory defines how ritual systems are constructed within the Ritual Music Systems project.

Its purpose is to externalize the principles, dimensions, rules, and methods that govern the creation of ritual system instances, without encoding any specific ritual content, style, belief, or aesthetic.

This layer exists to prevent implicit assumptions, taste anchoring, and first-instance bias.

## 2. Scope

This framework governs:

- how a ritual system is defined
- which dimensions every ritual system must explicitly declare
- how constraints are authored and enforced
- how provenance, liturgy, language, and sound are structured procedurally
- how ritual systems are instantiated, evolved, frozen, forked, or archived

This framework does **not** define any actual ritual systems.

## 3. Non-Goals

This framework explicitly does **not**:

- define lyrics, prayers, chants, or texts
- describe musical style or genre
- encode emotional or aesthetic targets
- provide creative inspiration
- optimize for output quality
- justify meaning, belief, or symbolism

Any document that attempts to do so is invalid in this layer.

## 4. Relationship to Canon

Canon is frozen and authoritative.

This framework does not modify, reinterpret, or extend canon.  
It operates strictly under canonical constraints and exists solely in the lab.

If a conflict arises between this framework and canon, canon overrides without exception.

## 5. Relationship to Ritual Systems

A ritual system instance is considered valid only if it:

- explicitly defines every required design dimension
- follows the rules and methods specified here
- declares its provenance, constraints, and lifecycle state
- maintains lineage and auditability

Ritual systems are disposable. This framework is not.

## 6. Enforcement Principle

Nothing is implicit.

Every assumption must be externalized, declared, or forbidden.

Undefined dimensions constitute system failure.
