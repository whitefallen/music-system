## 1. System State

This ritual system is **frozen at version 1.0**.

No further structural changes, re-interpretations, or retroactive adjustments are permitted.

Future work may only occur through:

- generation under existing constraints, or
- explicit forking into a new ritual system instance

## 2. Purpose of This Note

This document clarifies the role of the **Anchor Piece** within the Arrival / Prophetic EP ritual system.

It exists to prevent misclassification, retroactive narrative framing, or stylistic dilution of the anchor’s function.

## 3. The Anchor Piece (Track 00)

**Dark Symphonic Ritual (God Descent)** is designated as a **Special Track — Anchor**.

It is not part of the numbered narrative or administrative arc.
It is not a post-event ritual.
It is not an explanatory or transitional piece.

Its role is **orientational**, not sequential.

## 4. Function of the Anchor Piece

The Anchor Piece establishes the **arrival grammar** for the entire system.

Specifically, it fixes the following invariants:

- Arrival is inevitable, not summoned
- Divinity is ontological pressure, not moral authority
- Presence alone is catastrophic
- Endurance precedes interpretation

All later arrival rituals (Tracks 1–3) are variations of this grammar.

## 5. What the Anchor Piece Is Not

The Anchor Piece does not:

- introduce doctrine
- justify belief
- resolve meaning
- establish outcome

It provides **structural posture**, not content.

## 6. Relationship to the Trilogy (Tracks 1–3)

Tracks 1–3 elaborate arrival consequences:

- Order imposed
- Doom enforced
- Meaning negated

The Anchor Piece precedes these distinctions.

It demonstrates arrival **before** order, doom, or void are conceptualized.

## 7. Systemic Importance

Without the Anchor Piece:

- arrival risks moral framing
- divinity risks authority interpretation
- later rituals risk appearing reactionary

The Anchor Piece prevents these failures by fixing arrival as a natural, non-dialogic event.

## 8. Governance Note

Any future system that reuses this Anchor Piece must:

- explicitly inherit its ritual grammar, or
- explicitly reject it during system instantiation

Implicit reuse is forbidden.
