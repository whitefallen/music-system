## 1. Ritual Identity

- **Track Title:** Dark Symphonic Ritual (God Descent)
- **Ritual Function:** Arrival / Endurance
- **Ritual Moment:** Exact moment of divine descent, experienced as ontological pressure entering the world
- **Special Status:** Anchor Piece (Orienting Ritual)

## 2. Belief Posture

- **Core Belief:** Divinity descends by inevitability, not invitation. Its presence alone is sufficient.
- **Belief Status:** Absolute, non-moral, and non-responsive.
- **Internal Perspective:** Fully inhabited by the believing collective.

Divinity is neither benevolent nor judging. It is force, not authority.

## 3. Ritual Provenance (Track-Level)

- **Primary Provenance:** oriental-archaic descent ritual authority
- **Secondary Provenance:** none
- **Forbidden Provenance:** benevolent theism, moral judgment, dialogic invocation, salvific framing
- **Track-Specific Drift Indicators:** praise language, summoning posture, explanatory theology

## 4. Liturgy (Track-Specific)

- **Permitted Segments:** endurance, acknowledgment, sealing

- **Endurance Function:** Withstanding divine presence without appeal or resistance

- **Acknowledgment Function:** Procedural recognition of descent without interpretation

- **Sealing Function:** Stabilizing reality under sustained pressure

- **Repetition Doctrine:** Reinforcement of endurance; no escalation

- **Prohibited Forms:** summoning, praise, welcome, resistance

## 5. Language and Speech

- **Register:** archaic, austere, declarative-liturgical
- **Pronoun Posture:** collective first-person; impersonal address
- **Line Behavior:** extended chant-breath lines, minimal articulation
- **Forbidden Language:** moral attribution, intent speculation, explanatory phrasing

## 6. Atmosphere

- **Pressure Level:** extreme and constant
- **Enclosure:** vast and oppressive
- **Continuity:** invariant
- **Silence Usage:** minimal; silence as endurance gap
- **Forbidden Atmospheric Behavior:** relief, reverence swell, emotive climax

## 7. Instrumentation

- **Primary Vector:** male choir, impersonal and massed
- **Environmental Carriers:** deep orchestral drones and static harmonic weight
- **Marking Agents:** none
- **Density Behavior:** sustained maximum without growth
- **Forbidden Behaviors:** heroic gesture, melodic foregrounding, anthem behavior

## 8. Structural Limits

- **Liturgical Length:** moderate
- **Repetition Limits:** bounded
- **Density Limits:** invariant
- **Silence Limits:** brief and functional

## 9. Genre Relations

- **Stance:** boundary
- **Excluded Conventions:** symphonic heroism, operatic exaltation, cinematic ascent
- **Operational Reference Only:** ritual symphonic mass without genre identity

## 10. Symbolic Density

- **Allowance:** minimal
- **Function:** descent markers only
- **Accumulation:** prohibited
- **Forbidden Use:** symbolic divinity narrative, mythic explanation

## 11. Temporal Behavior

- **Mode:** static
- **Transitions:** none
- **Escalation:** prohibited
- **End-State:** sustained endurance under presence

## 12. Sequence Role and Systemic Function

- **Sequence Placement:** Precursor / Orientation (Tracks I–III zone)
- **Systemic Role:**

  - establishes descent as natural event
  - frames divinity as ontological pressure
  - sets tonal and structural grammar for subsequent arrivals

This track is not post-event or administrative. It is a pure arrival rite.

## 13. Validation Notes

- Functions as stylistic and systematic anchor for the entire EP.
- All later arrival rituals derive grammar, restraint, and posture from this schema.
- No moral, dialogic, or interpretive framing permitted.
- Ready for reference and generation under system rules.
