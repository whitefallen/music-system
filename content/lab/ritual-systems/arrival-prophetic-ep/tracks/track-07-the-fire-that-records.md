## 1. Ritual Identity

- **Track Title:** The Fire That Records
- **Ritual Function:** Witnessing / Inscription
- **Ritual Moment:** Exact moment when existence is exposed to constant fire and rendered exact as record

## 2. Belief Posture

- **Core Belief:** Existence leaves a trace simply by enduring. Fire records without judgment or intent.
- **Belief Status:** Absolute, procedural, and non-teleological.
- **Internal Perspective:** Fully inhabited by the believing collective.

Fire is neither destruction nor purification. It is witness without intention.

## 3. Ritual Provenance (Track-Level)

- **Primary Provenance:** custodial–archival authority (terminal)
- **Secondary Provenance:** none
- **Forbidden Provenance:** purifying, punitive, redemptive, transformative
- **Track-Specific Drift Indicators:** framing fire as cleansing, destructive, or morally charged

## 4. Liturgy (Track-Specific)

- **Permitted Segments:** invocation, exposure, inscription, sealing

- **Invocation Function:** Calling the recording fire into constant presence

- **Exposure Function:** Subjecting existence to uninterrupted witnessing

- **Inscription Function:** Fixing what endures as record without alteration

- **Sealing Function:** Closing the act of recording

- **Repetition Doctrine:** Reinforcement of witnessing; no escalation

- **Prohibited Forms:** purification rites, judgment, erasure

## 5. Language and Speech

- **Register:** austere, declarative-liturgical
- **Pronoun Posture:** collective first-person; impersonal address
- **Line Behavior:** extended, even chant-breath lines
- **Forbidden Language:** transformational claims, moral attribution, outcome valuation

## 6. Atmosphere

- **Pressure Level:** steady and unblinking
- **Enclosure:** open yet inescapable
- **Continuity:** invariant
- **Silence Usage:** minimal; silence marks completion of inscription
- **Forbidden Atmospheric Behavior:** heat-as-drama, tension release, expressive surge

## 7. Instrumentation

- **Primary Vector:** male choir, neutral and unwavering
- **Environmental Carriers:** sustained high-frequency textures and low drones
- **Marking Agents:** subtle, continuous sonic presence
- **Density Behavior:** constant; no growth or decay
- **Forbidden Behaviors:** dynamic swell, violent gesture, cathartic motion

## 8. Structural Limits

- **Liturgical Length:** moderate and bounded
- **Repetition Limits:** strict; termination required
- **Density Limits:** invariant
- **Silence Limits:** explicit and brief

## 9. Genre Relations

- **Stance:** boundary
- **Excluded Conventions:** purgatorial drama, infernal spectacle, climactic fire imagery
- **Operational Reference Only:** archival ritual textures without genre identity

## 10. Symbolic Density

- **Allowance:** minimal
- **Function:** inscription and witnessing markers
- **Accumulation:** prohibited
- **Forbidden Use:** symbolic purification, moral fire allegory

## 11. Temporal Behavior

- **Mode:** static → sealed
- **Transitions:** none
- **Escalation:** prohibited
- **End-State:** recorded persistence without transformation

## 12. Validation Notes

- Track conforms to parent system constraints.
- Fire framed strictly as registrar, not agent.
- Existence converted into record without outcome.
- Ready for generation under system rules.
