## 1. Ritual Identity

- **Track Title:** The Silence After Prophecy
- **Ritual Function:** Termination / Cessation
- **Ritual Moment:** Exact moment after fulfillment, record, and witnessing when speech is withdrawn and interpretation is terminated

## 2. Belief Posture

- **Core Belief:** Prophecy loses authority once fulfilled. After the event, language is excess.
- **Belief Status:** Absolute, procedural, and final.
- **Internal Perspective:** Fully inhabited by the believing collective.

Silence is not absence; it is the enforced condition in which nothing further may be said.

## 3. Ritual Provenance (Track-Level)

- **Primary Provenance:** post-prophetic closure authority (anti-interpretive)
- **Secondary Provenance:** none
- **Forbidden Provenance:** memorializing, exegetical, myth-making, redemptive narration
- **Track-Specific Drift Indicators:** emergence of commentary, retrospective meaning, narrative framing

## 4. Liturgy (Track-Specific)

- **Permitted Segments:** withdrawal, sealing

- **Withdrawal Function:** Procedural removal of speech and utterance

- **Sealing Function:** Locking the event against reinterpretation

- **Repetition Doctrine:** none; repetition risks reactivation

- **Prohibited Forms:** explanation, justification, memorialization, recitation

## 5. Language and Speech

- **Register:** null / withdrawn
- **Pronoun Posture:** none
- **Line Behavior:** none; speech is terminated
- **Forbidden Language:** all utterance beyond minimal sealing markers

## 6. Atmosphere

- **Pressure Level:** contained and absolute
- **Enclosure:** total and final
- **Continuity:** invariant
- **Silence Usage:** dominant; silence is the ritual medium
- **Forbidden Atmospheric Behavior:** tension, release, expressive motion

## 7. Instrumentation

- **Primary Vector:** none (speech withdrawn)
- **Environmental Carriers:** residual low-frequency presence only, if any
- **Marking Agents:** none
- **Density Behavior:** near-zero; subtraction enforced
- **Forbidden Behaviors:** melody, rhythm, gesture

## 8. Structural Limits

- **Liturgical Length:** minimal and bounded
- **Repetition Limits:** none permitted
- **Density Limits:** enforced reduction to silence
- **Silence Limits:** silence constitutes the structure

## 9. Genre Relations

- **Stance:** neutrality
- **Excluded Conventions:** epilogue, memorial silence, reflective aftermath
- **Operational Reference Only:** none

## 10. Symbolic Density

- **Allowance:** prohibited
- **Function:** none
- **Accumulation:** none
- **Forbidden Use:** symbolic silence, implied meaning cues

## 11. Temporal Behavior

- **Mode:** sealed
- **Transitions:** none
- **Escalation:** prohibited
- **End-State:** terminal cessation of speech

## 12. Validation Notes
