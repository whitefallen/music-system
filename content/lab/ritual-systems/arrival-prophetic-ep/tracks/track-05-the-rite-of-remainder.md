## 1. Ritual Identity

- **Track Title:** The Rite of Remainder
- **Ritual Function:** Containment / Burial
- **Ritual Moment:** Exact moment after prophecy, destruction, or revelation when residual existence persists and must be isolated

## 2. Belief Posture

- **Core Belief:** Fulfillment is never total. What remains after final acts is unacceptable by continuation.
- **Belief Status:** Absolute, procedural, and non-redemptive.
- **Internal Perspective:** Fully inhabited by the believing collective.

Remainder is not error, lesson, or meaning. It is a dangerous residue that must be contained.

## 3. Ritual Provenance (Track-Level)

- **Primary Provenance:** post-catastrophic custodial authority (non-redemptive)
- **Secondary Provenance:** none
- **Forbidden Provenance:** purifying, redemptive, interpretive, restorative
- **Track-Specific Drift Indicators:** framing remainder as meaningful, instructive, or purgable through understanding

## 4. Liturgy (Track-Specific)

- **Permitted Segments:** invocation, isolation, sealing, burial

- **Invocation Function:** Acknowledging the presence of residual continuation

- **Isolation Function:** Formal separation of remainder from all systems of meaning

- **Sealing Function:** Denial of spread, recurrence, or reinterpretation

- **Burial Function:** Procedural removal from active reality without annihilation

- **Repetition Doctrine:** Reinforcement of containment; no escalation

- **Prohibited Forms:** correction, annihilation, interpretation, purification

## 5. Language and Speech

- **Register:** austere, procedural-liturgical
- **Pronoun Posture:** collective first-person; impersonal declarative address
- **Line Behavior:** extended, restrained chant-breath lines
- **Forbidden Language:** explanatory framing, metaphoric redemption, instructional tone

## 6. Atmosphere

- **Pressure Level:** contained and suffocating
- **Enclosure:** sealed and subterranean
- **Continuity:** invariant
- **Silence Usage:** permitted as burial and closure
- **Forbidden Atmospheric Behavior:** release, resolution, moral clarity

## 7. Instrumentation

- **Primary Vector:** male choir, restrained and impersonal
- **Environmental Carriers:** low drones and weight-bearing textures
- **Marking Agents:** minimal, distant burial markers
- **Density Behavior:** reduced and compressed; no growth
- **Forbidden Behaviors:** violence, catharsis, expressive contrast

## 8. Structural Limits

- **Liturgical Length:** moderate and bounded
- **Repetition Limits:** strict; termination required
- **Density Limits:** capped; reduction favored over accumulation
- **Silence Limits:** explicit and functional

## 9. Genre Relations

- **Stance:** boundary
- **Excluded Conventions:** apocalyptic climax, aftermath lament, narrative epilogue
- **Operational Reference Only:** custodial ritual textures without genre identity

## 10. Symbolic Density

- **Allowance:** minimal
- **Function:** containment and burial markers
- **Accumulation:** prohibited
- **Forbidden Use:** symbolic redemption, closure metaphors

## 11. Temporal Behavior

- **Mode:** static → sealed
- **Transitions:** none
- **Escalation:** prohibited
- **End-State:** contained persistence without resolution

## 12. Validation Notes

- Track conforms to parent system constraints.
- Track explicitly denies correction, annihilation, and interpretation.
- Functions as post-event containment prior to terminal silence.
- Ready for generation under system rules.
