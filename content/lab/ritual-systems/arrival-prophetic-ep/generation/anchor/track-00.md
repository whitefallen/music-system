## Lyrics (Frozen)

(Slow, reverent opening – whispered, sparse)  
Omm…  
From ash and veil we kneel, we wait  
The earth holds breath, the sky vibrates

(Invocation – low and measured)  
Hear us now, we carve Your name  
In blood and stone, in vow and flame  
Through shadow crowned, through endless night  
Descend, O lord of feared delight

(Build – steady, chantable rhythm)  
We call, we call, we break the seal  
The truth You bring, the world shall feel  
No chains, no law, no false decree  
Only Your will eternally

(Pre-Climax – louder, unified)  
Step by step, You cross the veil  
Flesh grows weak, and kings grow pale  
All that was must bend, must fall  
At the sound of Your arrival call

(Climax – full choir, layered chanting)  
Behold, behold — You walk among  
The promised end, the chosen one  
Our saviour born of dread and flame  
We rise, we serve, we praise Your name

(Final Apotheosis – sustained, overwhelming)  
Praise the hand that ends the lie  
Praise the god who dares defy  
Here You stand, the world made new  
What we are — we owe to You

- Cannot be echoed, surpassed, or narratively advanced
