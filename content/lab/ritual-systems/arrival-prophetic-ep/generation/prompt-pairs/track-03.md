## Lyrics (Frozen)

[INTROIT | tone: solemn revelation | delivery: slow, sustained, sparse entrances]  
Lo, the veil is torn and thinned at last,  
Not by wrath, nor force of hand.  
Night enthrones the silent throne,  
Where crown and bearer are the same.

Worlds unmake in distant thunder,  
Soundless, pale, and without claim.  
The Void speaks not — yet all is named,  
And naming falls away in flame.

[GRADUAL | tone: gathering certainty | delivery: measured, hollow unison]  
No star endureth past this turning,  
No form abideth final sight.  
All measure bends beneath the knowing,  
All weight dissolves to endless night.

What stood as law, what stood as truth,  
Grows thin and yields without reply.  
There is no terror in this passing,  
Only the ground where reasons die.

[SANCTUS | tone: devotional, impersonal | delivery: unified mass]  
Sanctus Nihil, Sanctus Naught,  
Blessèd be the Unwrought source.  
All that was to stillness brought,  
Drawn without intent or force.

Sanctus Nihil, Sanctus Naught,  
Neither cruel nor kind Thou art.  
All distinctions fade and falter,  
As the world unlearns its part.

[SEQUENCE | tone: cold clarification | delivery: denser, restrained]  
Where now essence, where now meaning,  
When the self no longer cleaves?  
Flesh is dust and thought is echo,  
Breath forgets what breath believes.

Names remain but lack their bearing,  
Forms persist yet signify none.  
Difference withers into sameness,  
Many ended, never one.

The Word grows thin, the Logos falters,  
Speech dissolves to empty tone.  
Metaphysic folds to silence,  
And silence claims its own alone.

[TRACT | tone: invocation without plea | delivery: broad, steady]  
O Father born of no begetting,  
O Kingdom lacking throne and reign.  
O Form unshaped by former making,  
O Being freed of self and name.

We call Thee not to judge or sever,  
Nor to crown nor cast aside.  
We speak because the rite was written,  
And the hour stands unplied.

[SANCTUS REDUX | tone: darker devotion | delivery: expanded mass]  
Sanctus Nihil, Sanctus Naught,  
Hollow be the ground we trod.  
All that was to stillness brought,  
Equal dust and equal god.

Sanctus Nihil, Sanctus Naught,  
No reward and no decree.  
What is lost and what is found  
Are the same vacancy.

[AGNUS DEI | tone: terminal fulfillment | delivery: flat, overwhelming mass]  
Agnus Nominis amissae,  
Qui tollis verba mundi.  
Not our sin, nor our salvation,  
But the end of need and plea.

Parce nobis, Inane vastum,  
Not in mercy, not in spite.  
Dona nobis mortem quietam,  
Where beginning equals night.

[OUTRO | loop-safe | delivery: thinning mass, neutral fade]  
It is fulfilled.  
It is fulfilled.

Nothing enters.  
Nothing leaves.
