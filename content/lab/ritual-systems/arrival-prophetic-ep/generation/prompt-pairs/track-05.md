## Style Prompt (Authoritative)

Dark ritual orchestral mass with geomantic austerity, Very slow, delayed ceremonial pacing, reacting after a completed collapse, Male choir only, restrained and incomplete, phrases truncated and reduced, Low strings, earth-toned drones, and muted resonant textures form static weight, Harmony remains low, austere, and slightly unstable, never resolving, Percussion is sparse and distant, marking placements rather than rhythm, Silence functions as blocked flow and containment, Atmosphere feels grounded, sealed, and tense beneath restraint, FX: deep earth reverb, dampened resonance, pressure-muted ambience, No climax or release; the ending feels buried and unsettled

## Lyrics (Frozen)

[INVOCATION]  
The sound has ended.  
The form has fallen away.  
What was spoken has withdrawn.

Yet the ground is not at rest.

We stand where meaning ceased,  
And still the breath moves wrongly.

[VERSE I]  
The axis remains mis-set.  
The weight does not descend.  
Ash lies without direction.

We do not ask what passed.  
We do not call it loss.  
We mark the place where it did not conclude.

[CHANT — LOW, REDUCED]  
Set the stone.  
Close the span.  
Turn the mouth of the earth.

Set the stone.  
Close the span.

[VERSE II]  
No voice instructs us now.  
No sign confirms the act.  
Still, the residue presses outward.

Where flow once gathered,  
It lingers without purpose.  
What lingers must be stilled.

[INTERCESSION — HOLLOW]  
This is not judgment.  
This is not memory.  
This is placement.

[VERSE III]  
The measure is not complete.  
The seal is not assured.  
We work beneath the absence.

If left unbound,  
The remainder spreads.  
If named, it reopens.

We choose alignment over knowing.

[CHANT — INTERRUPTED]  
Block the path.  
Lower the weight.

[VOID]

Block the path.

[REFRAIN — RESTRAINED, UNEASY]  
What remains is not permitted.  
What remains is not recalled.

We do not cleanse.  
We do not erase.  
We contain.

[FINAL SEAL]  
The ground is pressed.  
The passage narrowed.  
The breath reduced.

This place is held.  
Not finished.  
Not undone.
