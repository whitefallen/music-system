## Style Prompt (Authoritative)

Dark Ritualistic Orchestral Symphony, Gothic ascetic liturgy, Very slow, restrained ceremonial progression with low ritual undercurrent, Male choir only, calm and reverent, sung and sustained as a unified mass, Low strings, organ drones, and bowed textures provide static gravity, Harmony is modal, austere, and unresolved, avoiding emotional release, Percussion is rare and distant, marking vows rather than rhythm, Atmosphere is cold and stonebound, shaped by silence and air, FX: cold stone-hall reverb, low-frequency pressure, breath-held ambience, No climax or catharsis; the ending feels sealed and irrevocable

## Lyrics (Frozen)

[VERSE I | tone: solemn vow | delivery: slow, sustained, sparse entrances]  
We stand within the quiet nave,  
Where questions falter at the door.  
What once was sought we lay aside,  
What once was asked we ask no more.

The tongue that weighed the hidden things  
Is stilled beneath the binding stone.  
We face the wordless altar now,  
And claim the dark as ours alone.

[CHANT | tone: calm renunciation | delivery: hollow unison]  
We will not ask.  
We will not name.  
We will not seek  
The cause or aim.

What stands before us stands complete.  
We bow, and let the knowing sleep.

[VERSE II | tone: deeper submission | delivery: denser, restrained]  
No sign requires interpretation,  
No truth demands the light of thought.  
The mind that split the world in parts  
Is gently closed, and gently taught.

We loose the measure from the hand,  
Release the scale, unfix the eye.  
The need to know dissolves in prayer,  
And even prayer is laid aside.

[CHANT II | tone: sealing the vow | delivery: alternating mass and void]  
We close the book.  
We seal the breath.  
We choose the hush  
That follows depth.

Not false, not true,  
Not lost, not found—  
We stand within  
Unquestioned ground.

[BRIDGE | tone: threshold of obedience | delivery: fractured phrases, held silences]

[VOID | delivery: silence, breath withheld]

What was opened  
Now is closed.  
What was sought  
Is now disposed.

[FINAL CHANT | tone: irrevocable covenant | delivery: calm mass, collapsing vowels]  
This is the vow we do not break.  
This is the path we do not weigh.  
We do not turn, we do not choose.  
We stand, and let the meaning loose.

Unknowing binds us, firm and still.  
We are aligned by yielded will.

[OUTRO | loop-safe | delivery: thinning mass, neutral fade]  
It is sealed.  
It is sealed.

No more asking.  
No return.
