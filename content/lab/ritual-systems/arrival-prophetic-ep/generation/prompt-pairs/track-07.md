## Style Prompt (Authoritative)

Dark Doom Symphonic Orchestral, Apocalyptic Ritual, Occult Liturgy with Persian tonal color, Very slow ceremonial progression with suspended momentum and inevitable terminal convergence, Low strings and sustained bowed textures dominate; dark organ drones and subharmonic pads underpin, Modal harmony emphasizes Phrygian- and Persian-adjacent intervals, descending and unresolved, Brass appears in restrained, distant tones; ritual percussion is sparse, dry, and deliberate, Male choir only, bleak and emotionally indifferent, sung as one unified ritual voice; chant-driven with elongated vowels and firm consonants, non-heroic, Chaos emerges through harmonic tension and structural inevitability, not density, FX: dry stone reverb, low-frequency presence, subtle subterranean pressure, Final section resolves into a steady, consuming tonal presence, terminal and unrelieved, One continuous movement

## Lyrics (Frozen)

[STATEMENT]  
The fire is present.  
It doth not warm.  
It doth not consume.

It remaineth.

[RECORD]  
All things pass before it.  
None are altered.  
None are spared.

What endureth  
Is seen.

[APPLICATION — UNIFIED]  
Not by mercy.  
Not by wrath.

By presence.  
By duration.

[CONFIRMATION]  
The flame judgeth not.  
The flame remembereth.

What is brought near  
Is rendered exact.

[ANNOTATION]  
Ash is not punishment.  
Light is not gift.

These are states.  
These are records.

[DETERMINATION]  
What cannot endure  
Is not retained.  
What endureth  
Is unchanged.

[CLOSURE — INDIFFERENT]  
The fire remaineth.  
The fire recordeth.

[FINAL STATE]  
This is not ending.  
This is accounting.

The measure is complete.  
The fire persisteth.
