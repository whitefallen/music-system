## Style Prompt (Authoritative)

Dark Doom Symphonic Orchestral, Apocalyptic Ritual, Occult Liturgy, Very slow, long-form ceremonial progression with weight and inevitable terminal apotheosis, Low strings, sustained bowed textures, minimal melodic motion; ominous brass long tones, dark organ drones, subharmonic pads, Modal harmony with descending gravity, unstable and unresolved, Low ritual percussion enters late, uneven, Male choir only, bleak and emotionally indifferent, sung as one unified ritual voice; chant-driven, elongated vowels, heavy consonants, non-heroic, Chaos emerges structurally as harmony destabilizes and fractures over time, FX: infrasonic pressure, subterranean resonance, cold stone reverb, Final section blooms into massive orchestral impact and sub-bass surge, invasive and terminal, One continuous movement;

## Lyrics (Frozen)

[STATEMENT]  
The measure standeth.  
The scale is set.  
What is placed remaineth.  
What exceedeth is released.

Nor witness.  
Nor assent.  
The count proceedeth.

[RECORD]  
That which is measured  
Hath position.  
That which lacketh measure  
Hath no ground.

Existence is not granted.  
It is registered.  
What is unregistered  
Doth not persist.

[APPLICATION — UNIFIED]  
By count.  
By span.  
By weight.

By count.  
By span.

[CONFIRMATION]  
The rule changeth not.  
The rule heareth not.  
Still it holdeth  
All that stand.

Excess is not judged.  
Excess is unkept.  
What is unkept  
Passeth from form.

[ANNOTATION]  
There is no appeal.  
There is no exception.  
Measure alone remaineth.

[DETERMINATION]  
Enumeration precedeth remainder.  
Designation precedeth form.  
What cannot be fixed  
Is not retained.

Intent is not weighed.  
Plea is not marked.  
Placement alone endureth.

[CLOSURE — INDIFFERENT]  
Measured, retained.  
Unmeasured, absent.

Measured, retained.  
Unmeasured, absent.

[FINAL STATE]  
The scale is balanced.  
The record is closed.  
The excess disperseth.

This is not correction.  
This is registration.
