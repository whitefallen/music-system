## Lyrics (Frozen)

[VERSE 1 | tone: solemn, restrained | delivery: slow, sustained]  
Markèd be the ground of mortal make  
Scar’d by hand and word awake  
Stone yet bends beneath the sign  
Of works that crossed their bound and line

Cities stood where silence lay  
Names were carved to bid time stay  
Thus the fault before Thee borne  
Thus the rite at dusk of form

[REFRAIN | tone: cold invocation | delivery: unified mass]  
Come, Thou Weight that draw’st all down  
Come, and still each mortal sound  
Take what stood and leave no trace  
Set the land in elder place

Come, Thou Silence after breath  
Come, and finish life with death  
Nothing speaks and nothing pleads  
When the world forgets its needs

[VERSE 2 | tone: darker, heavier | delivery: denser]  
Road and wall and crown and law  
All were raised in human awe  
Hands that sought to shape the whole  
Left their scar on land and soul

Time was bent to human will  
Choice made lord of good and ill  
Thus we kneel, not born of fear  
But to still what lingereth here

[REFRAIN 2 | tone: deepening collapse | delivery: expanded mass]  
Come, Thou Hand that loos’st all form  
Come, Thou slow, unanswering storm  
Let all names like ash be shed  
Let the quick be join’d with dead

Come, Thou End without a face  
Strip the age from time and place  
Nothing stands and nothing stays  
When Thou draw’st the world away

[BRIDGE | tone: threshold, irreversible | delivery: sparse, crushing]  
Blood is given, not for gain  
But to loose the binding chain  
What was wrought by grasping mind  
Now to elder weight resign’d

Hear the stone beneath us shift  
Feel the ground begin to drift  
What was held can hold no more  
The seal thins to core and floor

[FINAL REFRAIN | tone: terminal initiation | delivery: overwhelming mass]  
Come, Thou End—Thou art at hand  
Works of man return to sand  
Steel and breath and word and will  
Sink into unasking still

None are sav’d and none remain  
Nothing lost and nothing gain’d  
Silence spreads where we once stood  
Order rests in quiet mud
