## Lyrics (Frozen)

[(Opening – distant, low)]  
From dust of kings  
From ancient stone  
We mark the time  
We stand alone

[Invocation – slow, grounded]  
Name unspoken  
Weight of flame  
Older than the sky we name  
Set before the first command  
Written deep in dust and sand

[Chant – unified]  
You do not rise  
You always were  
The silent law  
The waiting order

[Repetition layer]  
Always were  
Always were

[Build – heavier]  
Stone remembers  
Blood aligns  
All returns  
In ordered time  
Hands may fail  
Words may break  
You remain  
What forms take

[Pre-arrival]  
No prayer shaped You  
No voice called You  
You stood when all things fall  
We kneel not taught  
We kneel because  
The ground obeys  
What is, not what was

[Arrival – full choir]  
Behold the measure  
Wide and still  
The hand that forms  
The hand that stills

[Sustain – loop-safe]  
You arrive  
All is placed  
You arrive  
In perfect pace

[Outro – repeat as layers fade]  
All is placed  
All is placed  
You arrived
