## Style Prompt (Authoritative)

Dark Doom Symphonic Orchestral, Apocalyptic Ritual, Occult Liturgy, Very slow, long-form ceremonial progression with suspended momentum and terminal resolution, Low strings and bowed textures drift and destabilize, minimal melodic motion, Brass appears in distant, dissonant tones; organ drones and subharmonic pads sustain pressure, Modal harmony is unstable and unresolved, descending without closure, Ritual percussion is sparse and irregular, entering late as structural disturbance, Male choir only, bleak and emotionally indifferent, sung as one unified ritual voice; chant-driven, elongated vowels, heavy consonants, non-heroic, Chaos emerges through harmonic fracture and orchestral collapse rather than density, FX: infrasonic presence, subterranean resonance, cold stone reverb, Final section thins into invasive resonance and low-end surge, terminal and uncontained, One continuous movement;

## Lyrics (Frozen)

[STATEMENT]  
What was spoken  
Is complete.  
No echo followeth.

The sign hath passed.  
The mark remaineth.

[RECORD]  
That which was foretold  
Hath occurred.  
That which was awaited  
Hath no further motion.

Speech endeth.  
Condition persisteth.

[APPLICATION — UNIFIED]  
After the word,  
Silence.

After the sign,  
Stillness.

[CONFIRMATION]  
No voice is required.  
No answer is given.

What followed prophecy  
Is not meaning,  
But remainder.

[ANNOTATION]  
Expectation is void.  
Interpretation ceaseth.

What endureth  
Needeth no witness.

[DETERMINATION]  
The future is unclaimed.  
The past is unsealed.

Only the interval remaineth,  
Unfilled.

[CLOSURE — INDIFFERENT]  
Silence standeth.  
Silence endureth.

[FINAL STATE]  
This is not absence.  
This is aftermath.

The prophecy is closed.  
The silence remaineth.
