# Ritual Music Systems

## Purpose

This repository documents a **formal, system-oriented approach to creating ritualistic, non-expressive, AI-mediated music**. It is not a music project, an album repository, or a prompt collection. It is a **knowledge base**: a durable specification for how certain musical characteristics reliably emerge when constrained by philosophy, method, structure, and governance.

The primary goal is to **externalize memory**. No critical assumption, rule, or rationale should exist only in a person’s head or in transient conversation. Everything that matters is written down, versioned, and traceable.

## What This Repository Is

* A **production specification** for ritual-oriented music systems
* A **research artifact** documenting constraints, failures, and methods
* A **model-agnostic framework** for working with generative AI
* A **public reference** that can be forked, audited, and extended

This repository describes *conditions and systems*, not aesthetic tastes or personal expression.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

* Not a showcase of finished music
* Not a marketing site
* Not a creative journal or mood board
* Not a generic prompt dump

Any document that reads as expressive, inspirational, or promotional is out of scope.

---

## Core Principles

The system documented here is built on several non-negotiable assumptions:

* **Anti-expressivism**: music is treated as procedural output, not self-expression
* **Ontological neutrality**: no moral framing, protagonists, or narrative judgment
* **Post-human orientation**: systems persist without audience or witness
* **Constraint primacy**: rigor emerges from restriction, not freedom
* **High rejection tolerance**: most outputs are expected to fail

These principles are expanded formally in the `canon/` directory.

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by cognitive function rather than convenience:

* `canon/` – Stable, authoritative system definitions
* `lab/` – Exploratory ideas, proposals, and rejected concepts
* `templates/` – Operational artifacts used to execute the system
* `appendices/` – Failure analysis, comparisons, and defensive documentation

Only `canon/` documents define how the system *is*. Everything else exists to support, test, or protect it.

---

## Canon vs Lab

A strict separation is enforced:

* **Canon** documents change slowly and deliberately
* **Lab** documents may be incomplete, speculative, or wrong

Promotion from Lab to Canon requires explicit intent and documentation. This prevents conceptual drift and preserves intellectual lineage.

---

## Versioning and Stability

This repository evolves incrementally. There is no assumption of completeness.

* Early versions prioritize clarity over coverage
* Later versions may expand depth without altering foundations
* Breaking conceptual changes are documented explicitly

A changelog is maintained to preserve historical context.

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is written for:

* System-oriented creators
* Researchers working with generative media
* Practitioners interested in constraint-driven creativity
* Readers seeking reproducible, non-mystical frameworks

It assumes comfort with abstraction, formal reasoning, and technical documentation.

---

## How to Use This Repository

* Read `canon/` documents first
* Treat `templates/` as executable specifications
* Use `lab/` to understand how ideas evolved or failed
* Reference `appendices/` to avoid known collapse modes

Forking is encouraged. Attribution is not required for conceptual use.

---

## Status

This repository is under active construction.

Early documents establish philosophical and methodological foundations. Additional material is added only when it strengthens the system rather than inflating it.
