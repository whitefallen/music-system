# Genre Relations

## 1. Purpose

This document defines Genre Relations as a mandatory design dimension in the construction of ritual systems.

Its purpose is to regulate how, whether, and to what extent genre concepts may interact with ritual systems, without allowing genre identity to dominate structure, provenance, or belief posture.

Genre is treated as a boundary condition, not a creative driver.

## 2. Definition

Genre relations define the formal stance a ritual system takes toward musical genres.

This includes whether genres are acknowledged, excluded, constrained, or partially referenced as operational limits.

Genre is not a source of meaning, identity, or progression within this framework.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit genre relations:

* unconscious genre convergence occurs
* stylistic defaults override provenance pressure
* genre labels replace structural definition
* systems drift toward recognizable musical categories

This dimension prevents genre gravity from collapsing ritual specificity.

## 4. Permitted Stances Toward Genre

Each ritual system must explicitly declare one or more of the following stances:

* genre exclusion (explicitly forbidden genres)
* genre boundary (genres used only as negative limits)
* genre influence (restricted, non-dominant reference)
* genre neutrality (no genre reference permitted)

Implicit genre stance is forbidden.

## 5. Genre as Boundary, Not Identity

When genres are referenced, they must function as constraints.

Acceptable uses include:

* excluding rhythmic conventions
* forbidding harmonic progressions
* limiting instrumental tropes

Unacceptable uses include:

* naming genre as system identity
* justifying behavior by genre convention
* allowing genre-driven escalation

## 6. Multi-Domain Systems

If a ritual system spans multiple musical domains, it must declare:

* which domains are permitted
* whether domains are layered, alternated, or segregated
* whether domain interaction is fixed or variable

Unbounded genre blending is prohibited.

## 7. Relationship to Ritual Provenance

Ritual Provenance defines origin pressure.
Genre relations define operational boundaries.

If conflict arises between genre behavior and provenance bias, provenance prevails.

Genre may never substitute for provenance.

## 8. Drift Detection

Genre-related drift is indicated when:

* recognizable genre patterns dominate output
* genre labels appear in justification or evaluation
* genre conventions override declared constraints

Detected drift requires re-centering or system suspension.

## 9. Failure Conditions

This dimension is considered failed if:

* genre stance is implicit
* genre identity replaces structural definition
* genre blending occurs without declaration
* genre is used to justify expressive behavior

Failure invalidates the affected ritual output.

## 10. Systemic Role

Genre relations prevent ritual systems from collapsing into stylistic categories.

They preserve provenance bias, structural integrity, and non-expressive orientation across execution.
