# Instrumentation

## 1. Purpose

This document defines Instrumentation as a mandatory design dimension in the construction of ritual systems.

Its purpose is to constrain how sound-producing agents are selected, limited, and assigned roles within a ritual system, without encoding stylistic preference, virtuosity, or expressive intent.

Instrumentation governs function and hierarchy, not timbre fetishism or performance display.

## 2. Definition

Instrumentation is the formal assignment of sound-producing roles within a ritual system.

It specifies which agents may produce sound, what functional role they occupy, and how their presence conditions the ritual environment.

Instrumentation is structural. It is not orchestration in the musical sense.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit instrumentation constraints:

* instruments assume narrative or heroic roles
* soloistic behavior emerges by default
* genre gravity enters through timbral convention
* density escalates without structural cause

This dimension prevents instrumental agents from becoming expressive subjects.

## 4. Role Hierarchy

Every ritual system must explicitly define an instrumentation hierarchy.

At minimum, roles must distinguish between:

* primary ritual vector (e.g. choir)
* environmental carriers (e.g. sustained textures)
* marking agents (e.g. rare percussive signals)

Roles define function, not prominence.

## 5. Choir Doctrine

If a choir is present, its role must be explicitly governed.

Possible constraints include:

* collective or unison voicing only
* prohibition of individual or solo lines
* restriction of dynamic range
* density control (mass ↔ hollow)

Heroic, operatic, or anthem-like behavior is prohibited unless explicitly declared.

## 6. Instrument Classes

Ritual systems must declare permitted and forbidden instrument classes.

Declarations may include:

* sustained harmonic carriers
* percussive markers
* textural noise sources

Declarations must focus on function, not brand, patch, or aesthetic description.

## 7. Density and Allocation

Instrumentation must be bounded by density limits.

Ritual systems must declare:

* maximum simultaneous active agents
* conditions for reduction or collapse
* whether accumulation or subtraction is permitted

Unbounded accumulation constitutes drift.

## 8. Relationship to Atmosphere

Instrumentation must conform to atmospheric constraints.

If a conflict arises between instrumental behavior and atmospheric limits, atmosphere prevails.

Instrumentation may not introduce escalation that atmosphere forbids.

## 9. Prohibited Behaviors

Instrumentation must not:

* assume narrative agency
* perform emotional arcs
* introduce virtuosity or display
* compensate for structural absence

Any such behavior constitutes instrumental drift.

## 10. Failure Conditions

This dimension is considered failed if:

* instruments behave expressively
* choir functions as protagonist
* soloistic or heroic gestures appear
* density escalates without declaration

Failure invalidates the affected ritual output.

## 11. Systemic Role

Instrumentation enforces hierarchy and restraint within ritual systems.

It ensures that sound functions as structure and environment, preserving non-expressive ritual integrity.
