# Atmosphere

## 1. Purpose

This document defines Atmosphere as a mandatory design dimension in the construction of ritual systems.

Its purpose is to constrain the environmental and perceptual envelope within which a ritual operates, without encoding emotion, narrative, or aesthetic preference.

Atmosphere governs pressure, density, and continuity, not mood or feeling.

## 2. Definition

Atmosphere is the persistent environmental condition produced by a ritual system over time.

It is defined by structural properties such as density, openness, pressure, austerity, and continuity. Atmosphere is treated as an envelope that conditions all ritual elements rather than an expressive target.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit atmospheric constraints:

* emotional language substitutes for structural control
* intensity escalates unintentionally
* climactic behavior emerges by default
* silence and restraint are underutilized

This dimension replaces mood-based direction with enforceable environmental limits.

## 4. Atmospheric Axes

Each ritual system must declare its atmospheric position along explicit axes. Examples include:

* pressure ↔ release
* density ↔ sparsity
* enclosure ↔ openness
* austerity ↔ saturation

Axes are constraints, not goals. Midpoints and extremes must be explicitly permitted or forbidden.

## 5. Continuity and Stability

Atmosphere may be declared as:

* invariant across the ritual
* phase-based with defined transitions
* degrading or sealing over time

Uncontrolled atmospheric evolution is forbidden.

All transitions must be bounded and declared.

## 6. Silence and Negative Space

Silence is a structural atmospheric component.

Ritual systems must declare:

* whether silence is permitted
* where silence may occur
* how silence functions (containment, suspension, sealing)

Implicit silence is not allowed.

## 7. Relationship to Sound and Liturgy

Atmosphere conditions sound and liturgy but does not replace them.

* Sound must conform to atmospheric limits
* Liturgy must not override atmospheric constraints

Atmosphere is enforced across all ritual layers.

## 8. Prohibited Uses

Atmosphere must not be used to:

* encode emotional arcs
* justify escalation or climax
* substitute for structural definition
* imply narrative progression

Atmospheric description must remain procedural.

## 9. Failure Conditions

This dimension is considered failed if:

* atmosphere is described emotionally
* intensity escalates without declaration
* silence is treated as absence rather than structure
* atmosphere adapts to output preference

Failure invalidates the affected ritual output.

## 10. Systemic Role

Atmosphere stabilizes ritual systems by enforcing environmental consistency and restraint.

It enables austerity, containment, and non-expressive continuity across ritual execution.
