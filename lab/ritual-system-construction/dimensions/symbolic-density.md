# Symbolic Density

## 1. Purpose

This document defines Symbolic Density as a mandatory design dimension in the construction of ritual systems.

Its purpose is to regulate the presence, concentration, and function of symbolic material within ritual systems, preventing narrative inflation, myth accumulation, and interpretive overload.

Symbolic density governs quantity and function, not meaning.

## 2. Definition

Symbolic density is the controlled allowance of symbolic references within a ritual system.

Symbols are treated as structural tokens that may reinforce ritual posture, not as carriers of narrative, allegory, or interpretive depth.

Symbolic density does not determine what symbols mean. It determines how many and how often symbols may appear.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit symbolic density constraints:

* symbols accumulate without limit
* narrative arcs emerge implicitly
* mythological systems form unintentionally
* interpretation becomes unavoidable

This dimension prevents ritual systems from collapsing into mythology or storytelling.

## 4. Symbol Allowance

Each ritual system must explicitly declare whether symbolism is:

* prohibited
* minimal and sparse
* bounded and controlled
* structurally significant but limited

Implicit allowance of symbols is forbidden.

## 5. Symbol Function

Permitted symbols must serve a structural function.

Acceptable functions include:

* marking ritual transitions
* reinforcing submission or negation
* sealing or closing ritual phases

Unacceptable functions include:

* conveying narrative information
* developing characters or entities
* encoding moral or emotional arcs

## 6. Literal vs Abstract Bias

Ritual systems must declare their bias toward:

* abstract symbolic tokens
* minimal literal reference
* procedural markers devoid of imagery

Rich imagery, metaphor chains, or descriptive symbolism must be explicitly permitted or are otherwise forbidden.

## 7. Accumulation Limits

Symbolic density must be bounded.

Ritual systems must declare:

* maximum symbolic references per ritual act
* repetition limits for symbolic tokens
* conditions for symbolic removal or collapse

Unbounded symbolic accumulation constitutes drift.

## 8. Relationship to Ritual Provenance

Symbolic material must be traceable to declared ritual provenance.

Symbols that cannot be aligned with provenance bias are prohibited.

If conflict arises, provenance prevails and symbols are removed.

## 9. Drift Detection

Symbolic drift is indicated when:

* symbols multiply without structural necessity
* interpretation becomes unavoidable
* myth-like coherence emerges
* symbolic content begins to substitute for structure

Detected drift requires immediate reduction or system suspension.

## 10. Failure Conditions

This dimension is considered failed if:

* symbolic density is implicit
* narrative symbolism emerges
* symbols function as meaning carriers
* accumulation exceeds declared bounds

Failure invalidates the affected ritual output.

## 11. Systemic Role

Symbolic density preserves ritual austerity and interpretive restraint.

It ensures that ritual systems remain procedural, non-narrative, and resistant to myth inflation.
