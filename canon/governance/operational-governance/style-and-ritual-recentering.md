## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document formalizes **style and ritual re-centering** as a governance mechanism. It addresses a specific, inevitable failure class: gradual drift in musical style, liturgical language, and creation ritual despite philosophical and methodological compliance.

The purpose of re-centering is not to prevent drift absolutely, but to **enable controlled return to the system’s stylistic and procedural core**.

---

## 2. Scope of Governance

This mechanism governs three tightly coupled layers:

1. **Style Layer** – musical density, pacing, structure, and gravity
2. **Liturgy Layer** – language form, repetition logic, and vocal function
3. **Ritual Layer** – how creation, prompting, iteration, and evaluation are performed

Re-centering applies only to these layers. It does not modify philosophy or methodology.

---

## 3. Definition

**Style and ritual re-centering** is the practice of:

> Temporarily suspending forward iteration in order to restore alignment with the system’s anchor style, liturgical form, and creation ritual through subtractive reset procedures.

Re-centering is procedural, scheduled, and non-emotional.

---

## 4. Problem Statement: Why Style–Ritual Drift Is Inevitable

Even under strict methodology, style–ritual drift occurs due to:

* Familiarity with prior outputs
* AI bias toward variation and clarity
* Gradual expansion of prompt scope
* Tolerance creep in evaluation

This drift is often subtle, productive-feeling, and therefore dangerous.

---

## 5. Anchor Style as Gravitational Reference

The anchor style is treated as a **gravitational field**, not a template.

Re-centering restores:

* Tempo gravity (slow, suspended)
* Density discipline (weight without escalation)
* Structural non-song form
* Absence of climax and payoff

Re-centering does not reproduce prior artifacts.

---

## 6. Liturgy Re-Centering

Liturgy is re-centered by enforcing:

* Declarative over expressive language
* Enumeration over imagery
* Repetition over description
* Voice as texture, not subject

Any reintroduction of viewpoint, emotion, or narrative address indicates incomplete re-centering.

---

## 7. Ritual (Process) Re-Centering

Ritual re-centering applies to *practice*, not output.

Mandatory actions:

* Reduce prompt length and complexity
* Remove recent stylistic additions
* Narrow degrees of freedom
* Shorten evaluation windows

Re-centering is strictly subtractive.

---

## 8. Re-Centering Triggers

Re-centering is triggered mechanically, not emotionally.

Valid triggers include:

* Fixed interval (e.g. every N tracks)
* Post-release checkpoints
* Decreasing rejection rates
* Increasing prompt length over time
* Outputs becoming "varied" rather than consistent

---

## 9. Re-Centering Procedure

Mandatory procedure:

1. Halt generation
2. Ignore recent outputs
3. Re-read anchor style definition
4. Re-apply base constraints
5. Resume with reduced scope

No output comparison is permitted.

---

## 10. Prohibited Actions During Re-Centering

The following are prohibited:

* Referencing old tracks as targets
* Nostalgic alignment
* Output-level tweaking
* Emotional justification

These actions reintroduce drift.

---

## 11. Failure Conditions

Re-centering has failed when:

* Style continues to diversify
* Liturgy regains expressive traits
* Creation ritual becomes improvisational

Failure requires immediate repetition of the procedure.

---

## 12. Systemic Role

Style and ritual re-centering:

* Bounds aesthetic drift
* Preserves stylistic identity
* Enables long-term iteration

It functions as a **cyclic stabilizer**, not a corrective punishment.

---

## 13. Summary

Style and ritual re-centering acknowledges drift as inevitable and recovery as essential.

By formalizing return-to-core procedures at the level of style, language, and practice, the system remains coherent without becoming brittle.
