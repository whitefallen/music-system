## 1. Purpose of the Document

This document enumerates and formalizes governance failure modes within the Ritual Music Systems repository. Its purpose is to define how governance itself can fail, how such failures are detected, and how they are addressed procedurally rather than interpretively.

## 2. Definition

A **governance failure mode** is a recurring structural condition in which governance mechanisms cease to perform their intended function, even if documents, rules, or processes remain formally present.

Governance failure is systemic, not personal. It is independent of intent, competence, or participation.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without an explicit taxonomy of governance failure modes:

* Governance is assumed to function by default
* Failures are misattributed to style, tooling, or individuals
* Drift is addressed symptomatically rather than structurally
* Corrective actions become inconsistent or discretionary

The system loses the ability to govern its own governance.

## 4. Why Failure Occurs Without It

Failure occurs when:

* Governance mechanisms are treated as advisory rather than mandatory
* Enforcement steps are skipped due to perceived context or urgency
* Governance documents are interpreted instead of executed
* Exceptions accumulate without formalization

In such conditions, governance persists nominally while collapsing operationally.

## 5. Operational Implications

* Governance failure modes must be detectable independently of outcomes
* Detection of a failure mode triggers mandatory corrective action
* No discretion is permitted once a failure mode is identified
* Recovery actions are predefined and repeatable
* Governance failures are logged, not debated

Governance does not adapt in the moment; it resets to procedure.

## 6. AI-Specific Considerations

AI-assisted systems increase exposure to governance failure due to:

* High-volume generation masking structural violations
* Apparent coherence substituting for compliance
* Gradual normalization of exceptions through repetition

Therefore:

* AI output is not evidence of governance compliance
* Fluency is treated as a risk factor, not a signal of correctness
* Automated generation must remain subordinate to procedural checks

AI accelerates failure unless constrained by governance.

## 7. Failure Conditions

Governance is considered failed if any of the following occur:

* Mandatory governance actions are bypassed or deferred
* Canon is modified without an active release window
* Drift signals are acknowledged but not acted upon
* Canon–lab boundaries are violated without correction
* Freeze cycles are ignored or retroactively altered

Each condition independently constitutes governance failure.

## 8. Systemic Role Within the Framework

This document provides second-order governance: governance of governance.

It enables:

* Self-detection of structural collapse
* Non-personal attribution of failure
* Predictable recovery pathways
* Long-term system survivability

Without this layer, governance becomes symbolic.

## 9. Summary

Governance can fail even when rules exist.

Failure is structural, repeatable, and detectable.

The system survives by assuming governance will fail — and preparing for it.
