## 1. Purpose of the Document

This document defines the release and freeze cycles governing changes to canon within the Ritual Music Systems repository. Its purpose is to regulate when canonical change is permitted, how stability is enforced, and how temporal discipline is applied to prevent continuous mutation of authoritative frameworks.

## 2. Definition

A **release cycle** is a bounded interval during which approved canonical changes may be introduced.
A **freeze cycle** is a bounded interval during which canonical documents are immutable, regardless of new insights or experimental outcomes.

Release and freeze cycles are procedural controls, not reflections of project velocity or creative momentum.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit release and freeze cycles:

* Canon remains in perpetual revision
* Governance decisions become reactive
* Stability cannot be assumed by downstream users
* Drift detection loses a stable reference baseline
* Evaluation collapses into continuous negotiation

The system becomes temporally incoherent even if conceptually consistent.

## 4. Why Failure Occurs Without It

Failure occurs when:

* Canon is updated opportunistically
* Small corrections accumulate into untracked transformation
* Experimental urgency overrides stabilization
* “Minor edits” bypass governance scrutiny

In such conditions, canon ceases to function as memory and becomes an activity log.

## 5. Operational Implications

* Canon changes are grouped into discrete releases
* Each release is followed by a mandatory freeze period
* No canonical edits are permitted during freeze, regardless of justification
* Lab activity continues uninterrupted during freeze cycles
* Freeze duration is fixed per cycle, not dynamically shortened

Urgency is not a valid reason to bypass a freeze.

## 6. AI-Specific Considerations

AI-assisted workflows amplify the risk of continuous micro-adjustment due to:

* Low-cost generation of alternatives
* Perceived ease of refinement
* Tendency toward stylistic normalization

Therefore:

* AI-generated revisions accumulate in lab during freezes
* Canon updates require batch evaluation, not incremental adoption
* Freeze cycles counteract AI-induced overfitting

AI throughput must not dictate canonical tempo.

## 7. Failure Conditions

This governance mechanism is considered failed if:

* Canon is modified outside an active release window
* Freeze periods are shortened or skipped retroactively
* Unreleased changes are treated as authoritative
* Versioning does not reflect release boundaries

Failure requires rollback to the last stable release.

## 8. Systemic Role Within the Framework

Release and freeze cycles provide temporal governance.
They establish rhythm, enforce patience, and preserve evaluability.

They enable:

* Reliable reference states
* Meaningful drift detection
* Controlled evolution without continuous flux

They are a prerequisite for long-horizon system stability.

## 9. Summary

Canon changes in batches.
Canon rests between changes.

Release permits change.
Freeze preserves meaning.

The system advances by interruption, not acceleration.
