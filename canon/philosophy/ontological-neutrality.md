## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document formalizes **ontological neutrality** as a foundational constraint within ritual-oriented, system-driven music production. It exports a core assumption that has been implicit throughout prior work: that meaning, agency, and moral structure are not stable foundations for durable generative systems.

Ontological neutrality is treated here not as an ethical stance, but as a **system-level requirement**.

---

## 2. Definition

**Ontological neutrality** is the position that:

> No entity, force, concept, or process within the system is granted inherent moral value, narrative priority, or privileged agency.

All elements exist on a **flat ontological plane**.

There are:

* No protagonists
* No antagonists
* No heroes or villains
* No moral ascent or descent

---

## 3. Problem Statement: Why Ontological Structure Fails Systems

When systems implicitly encode ontological hierarchy, several failure modes emerge:

1. **Narrative Magnetism**
   Hierarchy induces story. Story induces progression. Progression induces resolution.

2. **Moral Optimization**
   Once value is introduced, outputs are optimized toward judgment, meaning, or message.

3. **Observer Re-Centering**
   Ontological priority implicitly reintroduces a human or interpretive witness.

4. **AI Bias Amplification**
   Generative models preferentially reinforce moral contrast and agent-centered framing.

These effects directly undermine procedural stability.

## 4. Neutrality as a Design Constraint

Ontological neutrality functions as a **load-bearing negative constraint**.

It enforces:

* Absence of judgment
* Absence of intention
* Absence of narrative causality

This allows:

* Procedural continuity
* Model-agnostic interpretation
* Reproducible evaluation criteria

Neutrality is not emptiness; it is **structural restraint**.

---

## 5. Operational Implications

### 5.1 Language

Prohibited:

* Moral qualifiers (good, evil, pure, corrupt)
* Value judgments
* Teleological verbs (redeem, condemn, save)

Permitted:

* Descriptive states
* Mechanical processes
* Declarative conditions

Language must describe *what is present*, not *what it means*.

---

### 5.2 Imagined Entities

If entities are implied:

* They possess no intent
* They do not pursue outcomes
* They do not change state as a result of conflict

Entities function as **structural placeholders**, not characters.

---

### 5.3 Structure and Form

Avoided:

* Conflict–resolution arcs
* Moral tension
* Binary opposition

Preferred:

* Coexistence of states
* Enumeration without hierarchy
* Parallel conditions

---

## 6. Relationship to Ritual

Ritual, within this framework, operates **without moral address**.

A ritual:

* Does not persuade
* Does not warn
* Does not instruct ethically

It executes regardless of belief, consequence, or interpretation.

Ontological neutrality aligns ritual with **procedure rather than doctrine**.

---

## 7. AI-Specific Considerations

Generative models strongly favor:

* Agent-centric narratives
* Moral contrast
* Implicit lessons

Ontological neutrality must therefore be actively enforced through:

* Prompt restraints
* Selection criteria
* Rejection of morally legible outputs

Without this enforcement, neutrality collapses rapidly.

---

## 8. Failure Conditions

Ontological neutrality has failed when:

* Any element is framed as deserving, guilty, chosen, or fallen
* Conflict implies moral stakes
* Outputs invite judgment rather than observation

Failure requires rejection, not reinterpretation.

---

## 9. Systemic Role

Ontological neutrality stabilizes:

* Anti-expressivism
* Post-human orientation
* Evaluation objectivity

Removing neutrality reintroduces narrative gravity and collapses system coherence.

---

## 10. Summary

Ontological neutrality removes moral hierarchy and narrative priority from the system.

This removal enables:

* Durable procedural execution
* Resistance to generative bias
* Reproducibility across authors and models

Without ontological neutrality, the system cannot remain non-expressive, non-narrative, or stable over time.
