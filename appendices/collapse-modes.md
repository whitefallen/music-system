## 1. Purpose of the Document

This document defines collapse modes within the Ritual Music Systems repository. Its purpose is to describe how systemic failure progresses beyond recoverable breakdown into irreversible or near-irreversible loss of function, coherence, or governance.

## 2. Definition

A **collapse mode** is a stable terminal or semi-terminal state reached when multiple failures compound and recovery mechanisms are no longer able to restore the system to an operational baseline.

Collapse is structural and procedural, not dramatic or expressive.

## 3. Problem It Solves

Without explicit collapse modes:

* Collapse is mistaken for temporary disruption
* Recovery efforts are applied too late or inappropriately
* Irreversibility is recognized only after total loss
* Post-collapse analysis lacks shared categories

The system cannot distinguish recoverable failure from terminal degradation.

## 4. Why Collapse Occurs Without It

Collapse progresses unnoticed when:

* Failures are repeatedly patched instead of corrected
* Governance exceptions accumulate without extinction
* Canon loses its stabilizing function
* Recovery actions are delayed by interpretation or debate

In such conditions, collapse is gradual but decisive.

## 5. Collapse Mode Categories

Collapse modes are classified into the following categories:

### 5.1 Canon Erosion

Loss of canonical authority through continuous modification, reinterpretation, or stylistic normalization.

Indicators include:

* Canon treated as draft material
* Frequent unversioned edits
* Canon documents losing procedural specificity

### 5.2 Governance Nullification

Collapse of governance mechanisms while governance artifacts remain present.

Indicators include:

* Drift detection signals ignored without consequence
* Release and freeze cycles bypassed
* Governance rules treated as advisory

### 5.3 Layer Collapse

Breakdown of separation between philosophy, methodology, governance, and structure.

Indicators include:

* Philosophical justification used to override governance
* Methodological constraints selectively applied
* Structural rules treated as flexible guidance

### 5.4 Evolutionary Inversion

Misapplication of evolutionary logic resulting in uncontrolled adaptation.

Indicators include:

* Novelty prioritized over survival under constraint
* Accumulation without extinction
* Governance adapting to outputs instead of enforcing selection

### 5.5 Automation-Induced Collapse

Collapse driven by tooling and AI acceleration.

Indicators include:

* High-volume generation overwhelming review capacity
* Fluency mistaken for compliance
* Procedural checks skipped due to automation convenience

## 6. Operational Implications

* Collapse mode identification overrides standard recovery procedures
* Recovery scope is reassessed before action
* Partial rollback or system freeze may be required
* Some collapse modes mandate archival rather than recovery

Not all collapse modes are reversible.

## 7. AI-Specific Considerations

AI systems increase collapse risk by compressing time between failure and irreversibility.

Therefore:

* AI throughput must be throttled during instability
* Automated systems must respect freeze and rollback commands
* Collapse detection prioritizes process violations over output degradation

AI accelerates collapse when unchecked.

## 8. Failure Conditions

This document is considered failed if:

* Collapse is discussed without mode classification
* Recovery actions proceed without collapse assessment
* Irreversibility is denied or deferred rhetorically
* Collapse modes are reinterpreted as stylistic phases

Failure of this document increases the likelihood of terminal loss.

## 9. Systemic Role Within the Framework

Collapse modes define the boundary between recoverable failure and terminal degradation.

They enable:

* Timely escalation of governance response
* Appropriate limitation of recovery efforts
* Post-collapse analysis with shared reference points

They complete the Failure & Collapse framework.

## 10. Summary

Collapse is not an event; it is a state.

Detection must precede recovery.

Some systems must be frozen, archived, or abandoned to preserve integrity.
